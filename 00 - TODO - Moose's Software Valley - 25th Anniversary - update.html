On 29-Jul-1996, my web page, then called "<b>Moose's $5 Shareware and Emulation Valley</b>"
went live.  It was my first "proper" web page (more than some simple HTML and images).
</p>

<p>
I LOVE developing software. At this time, I was a full-time professional freelance
computer analyst programmer, but I hadn't done much HTML or any Delphi or
published any of my own software as <b>shareware (try before you buy, trialware, donationware)</b>
before.  Almost all of the software I had created and worked on was for clients and employers,
running on powerful computers locked deep inside the buildings of large companies.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, the time was right, the stars had aligned, and I had a strong yearning to
create my own WEB page, learn HTML and Delphi, and write some programs purely for
the sheer joy of being creative and the challenge of bending the computer to my will !
And publish my software as shareware to try and cover the costs of running my PC
and hosting a web page, and maybe make a little money on the side.
</p>

<p>
I had tons of ideas (and still do !) for a wide range of novel and innovative
software projects that had been percolating around in my head for many years,
I had pages of notebooks full of ideas and designs, and now was the time to
finally turn them into reality.
</p>

<p>
I was (and still am !) also very interested in emulation - where some
clever software could effectively turn your PC (or Mac, etc) into an
coin-op arcade machine, an <b>Apple ][</b>, a <b>ZX Spectrum</b>, a <b>Commodore 64</b>,
or may others.  These emulators were exploding onto the scene at this time,
and my web page also contained these as they were released and a other emulation news.
<b>DASCade (Dave Spicer's Arcade)</b> and the <b>Cinematronics Emulator</b>
were 2 of the coin-op arcade machine that had already been out for a couple of years,
and more were coming.  <b>MAME (Multi-Arcade Machine Emulator)</b>
was still a few years away from it's first release (in 1999, if I recall correctly).
</p>

<p>
I was coiled like a spring, and put everything into my web page and developing
my new software projects - working 60-100+ hours per week.
</p>

<p>
Most of my software would be released as <b>$5 Shareware</b> - where people
could download and use my software for free, and, if they choose, they
could pay me $5 if they liked my software, wanted to unlock features that
might have only been available to those who had paid $5, and/or wanted to
support further development.  This was a really insane idea at the time,
because almost all other shareware was $20 or more.  $5 was a crazy low price.
No-one was selling software or shareware for $5.
<b>My hope was that at $5, no-one would bother pirating / cracking my software</b>,
and no-one would dare risk  downloading and using cracked copies of my software
(which might contain nasty surprises, put there by the crackers and pirates)
to unlock features that were otherwise only available to those who had paid $5.
</p>

<p>
And for a while there, this was true.  <b>My software became very popular
and started selling like hot cakes</b> almost immediately after my web page went live.
Things were off to a great start ...
</p>

<p>
But success brings problems.  Pretty soon, <b>cracked versions of my software</b>
were all over the internet.  I remember doing a search for my "CPU Monitor Crack"
in the late 1990's, and found more than 6,500 pirated / cracked copies
of this on the internet.  Clearly, some people were prepared to download
and use cracked copies of software (perhaps containing nasty sup rises
left by the crackers, thereby putting their computers at risk) even just
to save $5 lousy dollars.
</p>

<p>
All of my programs were developed using the "<b>80 / 20 principle</b>",
which says that 80% of the work can be done with 20% of the effort,
and that the last 20% of work takes 80% of the effort.
I developed programs and released them onto my web page
to see if people were interested, see if anyone used them or
gave me some nice feedback.
If people liked / used my programs, I would work on them to make them better,
add features, make them prettier, and so on.
So, my more polished programs (the ones where I have invested a
great deal of extra effort for a comparatively small result) are the
programs that people have supported and registered / paid for,
and/or the ones I regularly use.
</p>

<p>
My software won many awards and much of my software has been featured
on the <b>companion CD's</b> for many magazine and even some books -
see the text files that accompany my programs for brief details,
where they are known.  People would often email me and ask "can we
include your software on our magazine CD", and I would say "YES".
But, far more often, people would just download and include my software
on their magazine CDs without asking, and this was perfectly OK
with me as well (as long as the everything was intact and the ZIP file
included my readme text file).
</p>

<p>
Some of my software, especially
<a  href= "mooses_freeware.html#Solar_System_Simulator"> Solar System Simulator</a>
and <a  href= "mooses_freeware.html#Robot_Simulator"> Robot Simulator</a>,
were used ay my <b>University's Open Days</b>, where I worked as a lecturer and tutor.
Indeed, my one of my primary aims for teaching computer science at university
were to encourage students to love developing software and
exploring technology as much as I do, and to inspire students to
become a "<b>life long learner</b>", like me.
</p>

<p>
I had a lot of fun creating and developing my software -
<b>now well over 100 applications, games, utilities</b> -
and seeing my ideas finally become a reality.
My software has not made me rich or famous -
but <b>it was never ever about getting rich or becoming famous</b>.
Over the years, many 100's of people have emailed me and thanked me for my software,
and this has been wonderful and greatly appreciated.
Within the first 10 years, my web site had <b>well over 500,000 visitors</b>,
and that is without page counters for almost half of that time,
and with faulty or non-functional page counters a lot of the remaining time.
</p>

<p>
Since 18-Sep-2007, all of my software has been <b>FREE</b> apart from
<a href="overhead_cable_sag_calculator.html">Sag Calculator</a>.
See my web page update:
<a href="previous_page_changes.html#Shareware_Now_ALL_Free_Baby">
18-Sep-2007 :: It's ALL Free Baby !! </a>
</p>

<p>
My web page is now just a quiet backwater, in distant corner of the
internet where few people visit.
The days of lone software developers releasing software directly onto
their web pages are pretty well gone.
It's all about App Stores and similar non-sense nowadays.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, my web page will always be my "<b>HAPPY PLACE</b>" on the internet.
When I visit the
<a href="index.html"> Main Page</a>
and/or click
<a href="previous_page_changes.html"> Prior Updates</a>
and scroll down and read for hours and reminisce about happier times,
when the sun shone a little less harshly and the breeze was not quite so cold.
</p>


<h2>Will my web page still be around in another 10 years ?</h2>
<p>
Sure, why not.
As long as I'm still alive and not too senile, my web page will keep going.
I'll always love developing software, and I've still got a ton of ideas for interesting,
new, unique software that does not exist anywhere outside of my head ...
so I'm not hanging up my debugger and dev tools anytime soon.
And any software I create, that others might find useful, then I will release it here -
almost certainly for FREE, like 99+% of my existing software.
If someone else finds my software useful, then that's great.

Thanks to the

there are 100's of snapshots of my web site going back as far as 28-Jan-1999.

Here are some screen shots of my web page to show its evolution over time:
frames => no frames,
animated GIFs everywhere => few animated GIFs,

<p>
If you would like to see and explore my web site from the past,
I have included links to a bunch of my web site snapshots below.
Some are missing images, some are incomplete, and some are for web sites
that were purely mirrors to my main web site.
e.g. in the earliest days of Moose's Software Valley, my main web host was <b>Rocknet</b>,
but I had web site mirrors with <b>Tripod</b>, <b>Geocites</b>, <b>XOOM</b>,
and various other web hosts, just incase one or more web site hosts closed down
without warning (something that happened quite a lot back then and still happens today).
