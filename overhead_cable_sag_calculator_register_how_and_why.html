<h2> What Do YOU Get for Your Money ? </h2>
<UL>
	<!--
	Remove: 20-Nov-2021.  There's no way I can provide technical support.
	People use the Trial version, and only if it works for them do they buy the Full version.
	And they have the FREE training videos and on-line help included with Sag Calculator.

	<LI>	Limited but FREE, fast, and friendly technical support from the program's author via e-mail.
	If what you need help with is already well covered in the on-line help or
	<a href= "overhead_cable_sag_calculator_videos.html"> 					Training Videos			</a>,
	then I will refer you to this material, rather than trying to repeat the information again in an email.
		<br> (Why not
		<a href="email_moose.html">Email me</a>
		 now and put me to the test ?)
	-->
	<LI> 	Access to all <a href= "overhead_cable_sag_calculator_videos.html"> 	Training Videos</a>
			(FREE for registered users), so that you
			can learn to use Sag Calculator at your own pace and in your own time.
	<LI>	Access to the full functionality of the current major version of the program.  i.e. if you buy v3.1 of Sag Calculator, then all version 3.x upgrades are provided to you for FREE.  e.g. v3.2, v3.3, etc are free upgrades,
	<LI>	Discounts on major program upgrades in the future.  e.g. if you buy v3.2, and v4.0 is released in the future, they you will only need to pay the upgrade fee for the new version, which will be a lot less than the full price.
	<LI>	A greater say in future developments / enhancements to the program.
	<LI>	Notification by e-mail when the program is upgraded / updated.
	<LI>	A big thank you from me !

<A name=How_to_Register>
<h2> Sag Calculator - How to Register ? </h2>
<UL>
	Complete the
	<a href= "https://moosevalley.github.io/download/Register_sag%20-%20v2.44.xls" target="_blank"> Registration Form</a>
	(included with the
	<a href="overhead_cable_sag_calculator_trial_version.html">Trial Version</a></li>
	of Sag Calculator), and
	<a href="email_moose.html">Email me</a>
	it to me.
	<p>
	You can also download the
	<a href= "https://moosevalley.github.io/download/Register_sag%20-%20v2.44.xls" target="_blank"> Registration Form</a>
	by clicking
	<a href= "https://moosevalley.github.io/download/Register_sag%20-%20v2.44.xls" target="_blank"> here</a>.
	(This is an Excel spreadsheet file
	which can be loaded into any suitable spreadsheet software and filled in and saved).
	<p>
	The Registration Form contains a series of data entry boxes and some drop down boxes (for yes/no questions, and allowing you to select from various options).
	<p>
	<IMG SRC = pics/credit_card_vertical.gif ALIGN=RIGHT>
	The Registration Form allows you to enter the number of registrations required, the number of prior registrations, and so on, and automatically calculates and applies volume discounts.
	For payment, the Registration Form contains my bank account details, and my PayPal details, or, if you prefer, you can enter your credit card details.
	<p>
	Once you have completed the Registration Form, save it and attach it to an email, and then
	<a href="email_moose.html">Email it to me</a>
	<p>
	Upon receipt of your completed
	<a href= "https://moosevalley.github.io/download/Register_sag%20-%20v2.44.xls" target="_blank"> Registration Form</a>
	, your payment will be verified with my bank,
	and a special, unique <b>Registration Code</b> will be e-mailed out to you along with a special web link to allow
	you to download the fully functional Full Version of the program.
	<p>
	This special <b>Registration Code</b> will unlock the full functionality of the
	current Major Version of the program.  For example, if you register v3.2 of Sag Calculator, then your registration codes
	will work for all v3.x versions of Sag Calculator, including v3.1, v3.3, v3.4, and so on.
	If you register v3.2 and v4.x of Sag Calculator is released, then you will need to pay an upgrade fee to enable
	you to use the new major version of Sag Calculator.
	<p>
	You should receive this special Registration Code and other details
	via e-mail within a 1-2 days of receipt of your	completed Registration Form.
	<p>
	If you have not heard back from me within 2 days, then it is extremely likely that your company's email server is blocking my emails as SPAM.
	If this happens, please email me from an email account outside of your company - GMail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc -
	so that I can reply to you and send you the Registration Confirmation email.

<A name=License_Transfers>
<h2> License Transfers are NOT allowed!</h2>
<UL>
<p>
License transfers are <b>not</b> allowed.  Sag Calculator license ownership applies to whatever entity (company, business, person, etc) originally purchased the license(s), and these licenses / ownership <b>cannot</b> be sold or transferred or given to other entities (companies, businesses, people, etc).
</p>
<p>
Firstly, the original purchaser would have got volume discounts for these licenses, and these discounts would be different or no longer apply if they were able to transfer licenses to other people or companies.
</p>
<p>
Further, if a company purchased many licenses for Sag Calculator, then they have received a bulk buy discount.  If license transfers were possible, then they could transfer / grant licenses to other entities based - non-employees, other companies, etc - and this would not be fair or appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Also, if Sag Calculator was written to allow transfers, then a central licensing server would need to administer / check these licenses, and some form of transfer fees would be involved when a transfer was made.  Such a licensing server would be complex and expensive to set-up and maintain.  It would then be necessary for Sag Calculator to check the licensing server before allowing the full version of Sag Calculator to run on a particular device.  This would mean that Sag Calculator would require an internet connection to run - something that engineers sagging cables in the field may not have - so it would cause them frustration and hassle.
I have such software here (including games) and they can cause real frustration at times and the software refuses to run when there are licensing server issues, etc, even when I am at home and have a fast / stable internet connection.
I want Sag Calculator to be work flawlessly and quickly anywhere the engineers may be working - and I do not want to have them worry about connecting to licensing servers or messing around with internet connections in remote areas.
</p>
<p>
To summarise: License transfers are <b>not</b> allowed.
</p>
</UL>
