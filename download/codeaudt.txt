Introduction :
--------------

Program Code Auditor for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Program Code Auditor is a tool specially designed for :
- programmers, or,
- the managers of programmers, or,
- teachers of programming students
to analyse the program code that has been written, and
see how many lines of code there are and how much white 
space and comments there are in the code.

As every good programmer knows, white space (blank lines),
and comments in your code are *extremely* important
for your program to be understandable and maintainable.
e.g. A 10,000 line program with a single line of comments 
is a badly written program.

Normally, good programmers aim to have around 15%-20% of their 
programs as comments, 15%-20% as white space (blank lines),
and the rest code.

On the other hand, for HTML and WEB Page Languages, adding 
comments slows page downloading and puts more stress on servers.
Too many comments in HTML or WEB languages is a bad thing,
and they should be removed or filtered out of the code before
it goes into a "live" environment.

Program Code Auditor is a tool that lets you see how many lines 
and what percentage of programs are comments, code, white space,
or code with comments (on the same line) for each source
code file, and it also produces a summary of all source files
audited.  All of this information is written to a report that
you can copy to the Window's Clipboard, print it, or save it 
to disk.

Built into this program is support 17 languages so far :
 - Assembler
 - BASIC (Plain Text Files - not Tokenised - Listings)
 - C / C++
 - COBOL 
 - Delphi v1 / Turbo Pascal / Pascal
 - Delphi v2 or later
 - DOS Batch Files (IBM-PC)
 - FORTH
 - Fortran
 - Holos
 - HTML (WEB Pages)
 - Java
 - JCL (IBM Mainframe Job Control Language)
 - Lotus Script (for the brilliant Lotus Improv Spreadsheet)
 - NATURAL
 - PL/1
 - SQL

There is also an option for you to specify the comment start 
and end delimiters, and this should make Program Code Auditor 
work with just about any programming language !!

Program Code Auditor allows you to :
- Audit single files.
- Audit all files in a directory.
- Audit all files in a directory and all of its subdirectories.
- Exclude certain files (by their extension) from the audit.
- Exclude certain directories from the audit.  (Useful when processing 
  a directory and most but not all of its subdirectories).
- Load and Save profiles.

  Definition: A Profile is the groups of files and directories 
              you are auditing, along with any files you are 
              excluding from the audit.

N.B. The Profiles used by Program Code Auditor are 100% compatible
and interchangable with my Checksum Calculator, so you can use the same
profile to checksum your files (in Checksum Calculator) and then
use it again to audit your files (in Program Code Auditor).  

Pretty cool, hey ?

This program supports full drag and drop, so you can drag and drop 
files into the program for auditing.


Why I wrote this program :
--------------------------

In 1989, I was working for a company in Melbourne Australia,
and this company paid a small fortune (many thousands of dollars)
for a code auditing tool that does much less than my program, 
and it only worked for one programming language !!  (Natural)
It produced nasty reports, wasn't user-friendly, and
it was extremely limited.

My $20 Australian program is a versatile, flexible, stunning 
bargain in comparison !!  ;)

In addition, I became an active, internet based, shareware 
author / developer in July 1996.

Anyway, I was interested to know what percentage of my programs 
were comments, white space, etc.  And, I also wanted to know what 
percentage of my code was common code that is reused across all 
of my programs.

But, I particularly didn't want to pay 1,000's or even 100's of 
dollars for a program to do it.

Anyway, as I usually do, I just sat down late one evening and 
wrote this program, and by morning (I do tend to code all night)
I had finished and I could get the results I wanted.
(See "Example Audit Report" below).

Once I had the program working for one language, I added in support
for other langauges, and, with each new version, the list of supported 
languages grew.

In addition, you can also define your own "user defined" settings 
in the program - comment delimiters, string delimiters, etc,
and in this way Program Code Auditor could be made to work
for any source code.

Program Code auditor provides these answers to me, and
it runs so quickly that I get get the latest audit results on
100's of my programs in minutes or less.

Also, for the past few years, I have been working as a 
lecturer in some computer science subjects at a university in 
Australia.  And Program Code Auditor is invaluable for me here,
because it helps me audit programming assignments handed in
from my students, and it provides me with percentages, etc that
I can use to provide feedback to my students about their coding 
and commenting practices.


Auditing "Foreign" Code :
-------------------------

By "Foreign" I mean source code on non-Windows PCs, not people 
from Spain or England.  ;))

If you want to audit source code from another operating system
(Unix, MAC OS, VMS, Tops-10 or whatever), then transfer the source 
code (via FTP or whatever means works best for you) to the PC 
where you have installed Program Code Auditor, and you can then
audit the code.

Simple as that.

Make sure you convert to PC text file format (Unix -> PC or MAC -> PC
format with CR/LF at the end of each line.  FTP programs can do this
for you, or my File Tools program can also help.

I have FTP'd or otherwise transferred code from Unix, IBM's MVS, 
and Digital's VMS machines and audited 10's of 1,000's of 
lines of source code with Program Code Auditor.

I now know that in the first 4 years (July 1996 - July 2000) 
of part-time work on my shareware programs, I have developed 
well over 60,500 lines of Delphi source code, contained in over 
180 seperate files, and requiring over 2 MB of disk space.  
(This is just the *.pas files, and does not include the *.dfm 
or other files).  Much of this code is common code that is 
reused across all of my programs.

I hope you also find this program useful.


Testing Program Code Auditor :
------------------------------

I have a large bank of test cases for every single language 
supported by Program Code Auditor, and I run these through 
the program before I make a public release of the program.

You can rest assured that Program Code Auditor will
deliver accurate results for all of the programming 
languages it supports.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a directory - 
such as c:\utils\ - and run the executable file Codeaudt.exe.

Simply drag and drop files onto Program Code Auditor from Windows
Explorer and then click the "Audit" button to audit the files.

Or, you can use the buttons provided in Program Code Auditor 
to add directories, add directories and all of their sub-directories,
exclude files, etc.

Before you audit any files, you should ensure that the Comment Delimiter
settings (on the "Settings" tab) are correct for the programming language
that you are auditing.


Example Audit Report :
----------------------

Below is a audit report for a small fraction of my shareware's 
Delphi source code (in February 2002).

Programming Languages Supported "Out of the Box" :
--------------------------------------------------

The following languages are supported by the program so far.

N.B. In addition, you can also define your own "user defined" 
     settings in the program - comment delimiters, string 
     delimiters, etc, and in this way Program Code Auditor 
     could be made to work for any source code for any 
     programming language.

Assembler
	; everything after this on the line is a comment.
	' or " = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.

BASIC (Plain Text Files - not Tokenised - Listings)
	REM = Rest of line is a Comment
	" = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.
	Remove Line Numbers.

C / C++
	// = Rest of Line is a comment
	/* = Start Comment
	*/ = End of comment
	" = delimiting quotes for strings.
	' = delimiting quotes for chars.

COBOL
	* in Column 1 or 7 means everything on the line is a comment.
	' or " = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.

Delphi v1 and Pascal
	{ = Start Comment
	} = End of comment
	' = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.

Delphi v2 or later
	// = Rest of Line is a comment
	{ = Start Comment  (Open Curley Bracket)
	} = End of comment (Close Curley Bracket)
	' = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.

DOS Batch Files (IBM-PC)
	REM = Comment
	" = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.

FORTH
	( = Start Comment  (Open Round Bracket)
	) = End of comment (Close Round Bracket)
	" = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.
Fortran
	C, c, or * in Column 1 means everything on the line is a comment.
	' = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.

Holos
	! Anything after a ! is a comment.  Can appear anywhere on a line.  
	  e.g. after code.
	" = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.

HTML (WEB Pages)
	<! = Start Comment
	>  = End of comment
	' or " = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.

Java
	// = Rest of Line is a comment
	/* = Start Comment
	*/ = End of comment
	" = delimiting quotes for strings.
	' = delimiting quotes for chars.

JCL (IBM Mainframe Job Control Language)
	//* = Comment
	' = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.

Lotus Script (for the brilliant Lotus Improv Spreadsheet)
	' = Anything after ' is a comment - can appear anywhere 
	    on the line, and everything until eol is a comment.
	" = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.

NATURAL
	* at start of line means entire line is a comment.  
	/* Anything after /* is a comment.
	' = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.
	Remove Line Numbers.

PL/1
	/* = Rest of Line is a comment
	' = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.

SQL
	REM = Anything after this is a comment.
	' = delimiting quotes for strings and chars, and,
	" = delimiting quotes for strings and chars.


N.B. In addition, you can also define your own "user defined" 
     settings in the program - comment delimiters, string 
     delimiters, etc, and in this way Program Code Auditor 
     could be made to work for any source code for any 
     programming language.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Command Line mode, just like my Checksum Calculator.

- "Out of the Box" support for other langauges.
  e.g. Dbase / Clipper, RPG, Eiffel, etc.

- Better auditing, such as auditing the average number of 
  characters in each comment.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0  29-Jan-2001    First Public Release.
                    (9,834 lines of code / comments.)

1.1  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's 
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    Fix handling of null / empty files.
                    (11,146 lines of code / comments.)

1.2  31-Apr-2001    Add in built-in support for :
                    - COBOL 
                    - Fortran.
                    (Yes, many people still use these languages !)
                    (Added specially for Keith B).
                    (11,244 lines of code / comments.)

1.3  10-Dec-2001    Display Total Blank Lines correctly on the 
                    Audit Report's summary.  For Fortran, a "C", 
                    "c", or "*" in column 1 indicates a comment.
                    Add in support for a second comment start to end-of-line 
                    character.  e.g. Everything after a // in a line of C++ 
                    is a comment.
                    (12,228 lines of code / comments.)

2.0  21-Feb-2002    Massive Changes for this Release.  (Program doubled in size !)
                    Smart code processing and handling of comment characters within 
                    strings.  So, the C++ line My_String = "ABC // DEF /* GHI";
   Price Rise       is not counted as containing comment(s) any longer. 
    from $5         Fully generic auditing - no special cases or handling.
    to $20          (Prior to this, I checked for and handled COBOL, Fortran, 
                    etc first, and then processed languages with more complex 
                    commenting methods as a group).  Now, all languages are processed 
                    entirely by their comment start, end, etc characteristics.
                    Add "out of the box" support for 11 more computer programming  
                    languages (bringing the total to 17) : 
                    - Assembler
                    - BASIC (Plain Text Files - not Tokenised - Listings)
                    - DOS Batch Files (IBM-PC)
                    - FORTH
                    - Holos 
                    - HTML (WEB Pages)
                    - JCL (IBM Mainframe Job Control Language)
                    - Lotus Script (for the brilliant Lotus Improv Spreadsheet)
                    - NATURAL
                    - PL/1
                    - SQL
                    I have extensively coded in 15 of these 17 langauges in the past.
                    (Another few to add, and then that about wraps up my core 
                    languages since 1980.  Then I'll move onto my "fringe" languages ;)
                    Add in extra reporting options : report file name with or without 
                    the full directory path, and show line counts with or without 
                    percentages.
                    Improve the formatting of the report : Align all audit information 
                    according to the longest file name, add column headings, add
                    column footings, improve the look and readability of the report.
                    Add date and time, programming language selected, and Program
                    Code Auditor name, version, and web address onto the Audit Report.
                    Add in "Print Report" button to the Audit Report screen. 
                    This allows you to select the Printer and its associated settings 
                    (e.g. paper size, portrait or landscape, etc).
                    In addition, the Report is now generated in Rich Text Format, with 
                    fonts, etc, so if you copy and paste it to Word or anywhere else the
                    fonts and spacing will remain intact.
                    Add in "Ignore Line Numbers" option - useful for languages with 
                    numbered line numbers.  e.g. BASIC.
                    Add in a "Halt Processing" button - you can now halt the
                    auditing / processing of files at any time.
                    Move the Reset and Audit buttons to the bottom of the window so they 
                    are visible at all times.  i.e. they are no longer on a notebook tab.
                    Stop the process and inform the user if there are no files to audit.
                    If the file is empty or locked, then report this on the Audit Report.
                    Add in new sections to this text file :
                    - Auditing "Foreign" Code
                    - Programming Languages Supported "Out of the Box"
                    - Testing Program Code Auditor
                    Add in support for massive source code files with up to 4,294,967,295
                    lines of comments, lines of code, etc per file.  This program is now 
                    more than capable of auditing the largest source code files on the
                    planet.  I don't expect these sizes to be exceeded for some time !  ;)
                    Make "Expert Mode" the default mode now - it is much better after all.
                    Add Restore Factory Defaults, Always on Top, and 
                    Auto-Run at Windows Startup options to the File menu.
                    Brand New About Screen and associated functionality.
                    Add in support for the Maximise icon in the top right
                    corner of the program's main window.
                    This program is now for 32 bit Windows or later.  
                    e.g. Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, or later.
                    i.e. Windows 3.x is no longer supported.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Introduce yet more Anti-Hacker / Anti-Cracker measures.
                    Price Rise : the program is now $20 Australian dollars.
                    (Before this release, it used to be just $5 Australian dollars).
                    But, even at $20 the program is still an absolute bargain.
