Introduction :
--------------

Disk Monitor is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, netbooks, 
etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which includes 
Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Disk Monitor displays :
- the total disk space and the free (unused) disk space in bytes, KB, 
  MB, GB, TB, PB, EB, YB, ZB (whatever is most suitable) 
  for all drives you want to monitor.
- the percentage of free (unused) disk space for all drives 
  you want to monitor.
- the overall totals for all drives you are monitoring.

Disk Monitor will monitor up to 26 drives.

Colour coding is used to show how critical disk space is 
becoming : green indicates that less than 85% of the disk
is used, yellow if between 85% and 95% is used,
and red if more than 95% is used.

Never again will you need to worry about unexpectedly running 
out of disk space when downloading large files from the Net, 
saving large documents / spreadsheets, or restructure large 
databases, because now it is so easy to keep track of all 
your drives.  A quick glance will tell you all you need 
to know !

The disk usage statistics are updated everry 30 seconds by 
default, but this can also be changed (also under the 
Settings menu).

Windows, drive, etc Settings are automatically saved to the INI
file when you exit Disk Monitor.  The settings are also
saved on Windows shutdown.

You can also drag and drop files from Windows Explorer / File
Manager or similar product onto Disk Monitor to automatically 
start monitoring of the drive that the particular files reside 
on.


The Future :
------------

Much new functionality can be added to this program in the future,
such as :
- Add a column to hold the label description for each disk.
- Add a column to hold the type of drive : floppy, hard-disk, CD,
  network, etc.
- Add in a screen to display details of each drive - sector 
  sizes, number of sectors, FAT 32/16, etc.

If anyone requires any of this or other functionality,
or has any other suggestions, please email me and let me 
know !


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
------------------------

Version 2.3 of this program was included on
the INFOPC (french edition of PC World magazine, IDG) 
"the best tools to test your computer" cover CD 
for the February 1998 issue.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.1   25-Sep-1996   First Public Release.
1.2   29-Sep-1996   Improve Settings menu option.
1.3   02-Oct-1996   Fix problem with Menu wrapping on some video cards,
                    which truncated the bottom line of the main window.
1.4   27-Jan-1997   Add in Registration functionality.
1.5   05-May-1997   Now you can double click on the drive label,
                    space free label, or main form to refresh the 
                    drive statii.  Unfortunately, due to limitations
                    in Delphi, you cannot double-click on the 
                    individual graphs to refresh their statii.
2.0   09-May-1997   Massive changes for this release !!
                    By popular demand, add in support for monitoring 
                    of up to 26 drives - in the Registered version !
                    Make Usage Bar Graphs lie horizontal instead
                    of vertical.  Make main Window shrink / expand
                    vertically as drives are added / removed to the
                    monitor list.  Show disk space free out of 
                    total disk capacity for each drive.  Add in 
                    support for Terrabyte and Gigabyte abbreviations 
                    in the disk sizes.  Tart up the settings window.
                    Add in tool tips for each field on the screen.
                    Optimise code - to reduce repetitiveness.
2.1   24-May-1997   Save settings automatically on Windows 95 shutdown 
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Turn off "Drive not Ready" messages if the floppy,
                    CD, etc has been removed from the drive.
                    Start Minimised if set in Shortcut / settings
                    (Registered Users only).  
                    Improve application startup - size and position 
                    form before user sees it.
                    Use a yellow bar colour if the drive is between
                    85% and 95% used.  
2.2   17-Jun-1997   Add in Menu items for viewing my Shareware Catalog, 
                    the Readme file, and the Registration Form.
2.3   02-Jul-1997   Add in ability to display a Total's row, which 
                    will display overall disk space used, free, and 
                    total capacity.
                    (2,983 lines of code / comments).
2.4   11-Jan-1998   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    Remove scroll-bars from main window - which
                    appeared under some circumstances.  e.g.  when
                    monitoring a drive with 1000 KB left and the labels
                    are too long - a vertical scroll bar appears !
                    (3,133 lines of code / comments).
3.1   25-Aug-1999   Produce a 32-bit version of Disk Monitor
                    for Windows 95 / NT which supports big disks -
                    i.e. handles harddisks greater than 2 GB in size.
                    This is a 32 bit version for use with Windows 95
                    98, 2000, and NT only.  This 32 bit version 
                    will **NOT** work under Windows 3.x even with 
                    Win32s installed.
                    Work around another bug in Borland Delphi 
                    to fix NTDLL.DLL errors on closedown which 
                    occured on some Windows NT configurations.
                    Fix "About ..." dialog's free resources %
                    in Windows NT.
                    Enhance "About ..." window with buttons to
                    copy my email and WEB page address to the
                    Window's clipboard, so user can simply
                    paste them into WEB Browser or Email program.
                    Position the Settings Window at Screen Centre.
                    Add in ability to drag and drop files onto
                    Disk Monitor to automatically start monitoring 
                    of the drive that the particular files appear on.
                    (Registered Users Only).
                    Add a "Free / Used" header on the main screen.
                    (4,722 lines of code / comments).

3.2   25-Aug-1999   Work around another bug in Borland Delphi so 
                    the 32 bit version of Disk Monitor can 
                    correctly handle 30 GB and far larger drives.  
                    (Fix required due to errors in Borland's 
                    suggested fix FAQ2552D on their WEB site).
                    (4,718 lines of code / comments).

3.5   18-Apr-2000   Store the INI settings file in program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    Add in a "spinner" so you can tell when things are 
                    being updated in the graphs, etc.
                    Add in "Always On Top" functionality - available 
                    from the "File" menu.  (Added especially for 
                    my good friend Patrick Cullinan !)
                    (6,773 lines of code / comments).

3.6   17-Apr-2001   Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (9,574 lines of code / comments.)

3.6b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (35,573 lines of code / comments.)

3.6f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.
                    
3.7f  4-Jan-2015    Fix a couple of issues with this program running under 64 bit versions of 
                    Windows Vista, 7, 8, etc.  (Auto-run at Windows startup and refreshing).
                    Fix an issue with the total of all drives.
                    Stop the timer when refreshing the free / space for all drives and 
                    re-enable it when everything has been refreshed for all drives just 
                    in case the user has selected a LOT of drives (up to 26) and/or some are slow 
                    or take time to spin up - CD drives, etc - and the user has selected 
                    a fast refresh frequency (1 second).  This prevents updates from clashing 
                    with / piling up on each other.
                    Change the timer refresh increment from 5 seconds to 1 second.
                    Smarten up the Settings screen a little bit: add icons to buttons, 
                    change from bevels to groupboxes, etc.
                    This program now supports disk drive sizes well into the trillions of 
                    Zetta Bytes range (unless there is a bug in the pascal compiler I am using).
                    1 ZB = 1,000,000,000,000 TB.  Given that current hard-drive sizes max out at
                    about 6 TB, we wont be getting to ZB drive sizes for a little while yet !  :)
                    Change over to using 1000 bytes for a KB as per the "standard".  I hate doing this.  
                    1 KB should be 1024 bytes, not 1000 bytes.  But I refuse to use the stupid looking 
                    "KiB" abbreviation for 1024 bytes.  Stupid standards committees !
                    To avoid feeling ill, I'll just have to "avert my eyes" when I get to the part 
                    of my code that says "1 KB = 1000 bytes".
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.  :)
                    (976 lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (56,470 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all primary, library, and include files.)
