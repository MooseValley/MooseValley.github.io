Introduction :
--------------

Real Estate Agent's Commission Calculator is a very basic program 
for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

Real Estate Agent's Commission Calculator enables you to enter a 
property's price and it will calculate the Real Estate Agent's 
Commission based on calculations valid in Australia as follows :

 - 3% of the first $18,000
 - 2.5% of the balance

You can then copy the commission amounts (with or without GST) 
to Window's clipboard (by using the little buttons next to each 
value) and paste them into your own documents / spreadsheets / files.

You can also set the GST (Goods and Services Tax) rate.  
(At the time of writing, this rate is 10% - which has been a 
constant rate since GST was first introduced in Australia - but 
it may change in the future - so, I've allowed you to change 
the GST rate in the program to cater for this.)

A full history of calculations is kept, so you can use the drop 
down arrow on the right-hand side of the Property Sale Price 
data entry box to select any previously entered price to review 
the commission for this price.

This program is freeware - please distribute it and 
use it freely.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  

(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
--------------------------

I wrote this program because I have recently been involved 
in buying and selling properties and was horrified to see 
that ALL real estate agents in my area (Capricorn Coast, 
Queensland, Australia) are still calculating Agent's Commission 
and GST by hand - using a calculator and/or pen and paper.
(They didn't even have a spreadsheet set up to calculate this !!)

These calculations are NOT complex, but when rushing (to put 
properties on the market or to draw up contracts) it is 
easy to make mistakes, and I noticed more than one agent 
make errors in the calculations.

So, I have written this program to enable any real estate 
agent in Australia with a PC or laptop to calculate agent's 
commissions.

In addition, this program should also be useful to anyone 
selling a property to verify the agent's commissions being 
charged.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Credits / Thanks :
------------------

Nil.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\Real_Estate_Agent\ - and run the executable 
file : Real_Estate_Agents_Commission.EXE.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu 
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete this program 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Before doing this however :

- If you have selected / enabled the "Auto-Run at Windows 
  Startup" option (under the File menu), then you should 
  ensure that this option is not checked / enabled 
  (which you can easily do by re-selecting the 
  "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" option from under 
  the File menu).

- If you have used any of the "Create Shortcut ..." options 
  under the File menu, then you should use the "Delete All 
  Shortcuts" option under the File menu to remove these from
  your system.

Simple as that !


Limitations / Restrictions of the program :
-------------------------------------------

None.  There is no trial period and there is no "cutdown"
or "restricted" functionality that requires users to register.

This program is FREE software - any person and any company is
welcome to copy it, use it, and distribute it as they see fit,
as long as the EXEcutable and this text file remain intact.

If you paid money for this program, then you were ripped off,
and you should complain to the person who sold it to you !!
(Don't complain to me, it's nothing to do with me !!).


The Future :
------------

There are many things I could do with this program in the 
future, for example :

- Support for calculating agent's commissions in other countries.  
  (Send me an email and let me know how the agent's commissions 
  are calculated in your country and I'll add these into the 
  program).

- Enable the user to change the various percentages.
  So, for example, the commission could be calculated as :
   - 3.5% of the first $18,000
   - 3.0% of the balance

  instead of :
   - 3% of the first $18,000
   - 2.5% of the balance

- Enable the user to change the various thresholds.
  So, for example, the commission could be calculated as :
   - 3.5% of the first $30,000
   - 3.0% of the next $20,000 
   - 2.5% of the balance

- Anything else ??

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

Depending on how sophisticated the program becomes in the 
future, and how much work I do, I may end up charging a small 
fee to people who wish to use the program.
i.e. it may not always be Freeware.


Other Real Estate Software :
----------------------------

There are many other useful pieces of software that I could develop.

For example, I have already developed a basic computer system which 
draws up all documents relating to the sale and transfer of a property
- including all vendor, purchaser, agent, solicitor, property, 
etc details on all normal contracts and transfer documents.

However, this is currently for my own personal use - there is 
still a fair bit of work to do before this is a polished application.

Also, I am not a solicitor or a lawyer - so, I do not know if 
the system will work for all people in all situations.  And, I 
am certainly not prepared to release it for anyone else to use 
until it has been thoroughly tested and signed off by one or 
more solicitors.  

Are any solicitor's interested in helping test / verify such 
software ?  If so, then let me know, and in exchange for your help
and "stamp of approval" I will provide the program to you 
at discounted rates, so that you can use it yourself or sell it 
to your own clients.

Also, the REIQ Standard Contract, and the various transfer forms 
(Form 1, Form 24, Form Q), etc are all copyright material, so I 
will need some no doubt expensive legal advice before I could ever 
consider selling a program that made use of these copyrighted forms.

But, if any Real Estate Agents or solicitors or vendors or 
purchasers or any one else out there would like me to finish 
off this system and provide it for sale, then please let me know.  

If there is support for such a system, and I get some help from 
several solicitors, then I will finish this system off and sell it.
