Introduction :
--------------

Clipboard Tools is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, 
netbooks, etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which 
includes Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Clipboard Tools enables you to :
- Erase the data on the Window's Clipboard,
- View the Text or Bitmap data in the Window's Clipboard,
- List the formats of data currently available in the Window's 
  Clipboard
- Copy data (rich text, formatted text, etc) to the Clipboard
  and have it copied back to the Clipboard as plain text.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply unzip it to a directory and run it,
and then click the buttons to perform the functionality
listed above.

If you want this program to be "Always On Top" 
of other Windows, then select the "Always On Top"
menu option under the "File" menu.


Why is this useful ?  /  Why do this ?
--------------------------------------

I often work with DOS or Console applications, and these can 
be very twitchy.  e.g. you can select the text and copy it 
from any DOS character based application, but this doesn't 
always work - especially when the clipboard already 
contails data.

So, I originally wrote this program with the single "Erase
Clipboard" button to overcome this limitation / bug
in the Windows Clipboard - DOS / Console application
interface.

It has since been extended to provide other functionality
that can be useful from time to time.

For example, I also work all day long with various virtual machines 
(running under VirtualBox) and sometimes strange things have happen 
to the Clipboard (host or client) and Clipboard Tools helps me 
make sense of what the Clipboard contains and what might be going on
when there are Clipboard issues between the virtual machines.

The "Copy as Text" button should be useful for anyone who needs to paste data 
as text from or to Word Documents, web pages, spreadsheets, etc.
For example, I regularly copy and paste large amounts of formatted text from 
various sources into Excel spreadsheets often, and I was tired of going 
Edit -> Paste Special -> and then selecting text and clicking the "OK" 
button in Excel, so I added the "Copy as Text" button to Clipboard Tools.
This "Copy as Text" button reduced mouse clicks and hassle.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :
- Enable the display of more formats of Clipboard data - such as
  video, sound, etc data.
- Buttons to contain the last 5 or 10 items contained in the 
  Windows clipboard - to enable you to re-use and re-copy this
  old data into your documents, etc.
- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0   17-Apr-2001   First Public Release.
                    (2,887 lines of code / comments.)

1.1   13-Oct-2001   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Brand New About Screen and associated functionality.
                    Add in support for the Maximise icon in the top right 
                    corner of the program's main window.
                    (8,609 lines of code / comments.)

1.1b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (29,301 lines of code / comments.)

1.1f  17-Jan-2010   This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.
                    (42,459 lines of code / comments.)

1.2f  20-Mar-2015   Remove all of the sub-forms / sub screens and place all Clipboard information 
                    on the program's main screen.
                    Add a "Copy as Text" button which is very useful for me.
                    I regularly copy and paste large amounts of formatted text from 
		    various sources into Excel spreadsheets often, and I was tired of going 
		    Edit -> Paste Special -> and then selecting text and clicking the "OK" 
                    button in Excel, so this new "Copy as Text" button does all of this in 1 step, 
                    so it reduces 4 mouse clicks down to 1.
                    Add exception handling to the loading and saving of program settings (INI file)
                    so that the program executes and exits cleanly (no error messages produced) even 
                    if running from a read-only device such as a optical disk (CD-ROM, etc) or 
                    there are disk errors or the disk is full and/or the INI file does not exist 
                    and/or it cannot be created.
                    (577 lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (30,803 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all source, library, and include files.)


If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is possibly an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my WEB page - see below.
