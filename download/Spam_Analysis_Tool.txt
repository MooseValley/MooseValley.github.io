Introduction :
--------------

Spam Analysis Tool for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

This tool is especially designed for use by Mail System 
Administrators, or anyone else who runs an email server or 
wants to block spam / junk emails.

N.B.  This is probably NOT the sort of program that novice 
PC users will find very useful.

SPAM (i.e unsolicited junk email) is a rotten scurge that is 
annoying millions of internet users and causing all sorts of
havoc due to clogged mail boxes and clogged servers, not to mention
the nasty payloads (viruses, trojans, etc) that many spam emails 
contain.

Most email clients (such as Outlook) allow you to save emails 
to your harddisk with the headers intact.  e.g. in Outlook, 
simply drag and drop the spam emails to a directory on your 
harddisk.   (Do not open them or run any programs they contain).

Once saved to your harddrive with the email headers intact, these 
spam emails can be analysed so that their real source can be 
identified, and then all emails from this source can be blocked 
in the future.  Doing this will help reduce the volumes of 
spam that you receive in the future.

Spam Analysis Tool enables you to :
- Step through directories full of spam email, 
- View just the email headers or the entire email,
- View each spam email's contents with colour coding
- Select text (such as IP addresses, email addresses, etc) 
  at the click of the mouse button, and add these to a list 
  of unique items (which can be incorporated into a block file), 
- And do various other things.

See "Using this Program" below for further information.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Spam Analysis Tool will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply unzip it to a directory (using 
PKUNIP, WinZIP, or similar), run it, and drag and drop spam 
email files and then click on the buttons to perform the 
various activities that you require.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

If you want this program to be "Always On Top" 
of other Windows, then select the "Always On Top"
menu option under the "File" menu.

Spam Analysis Tool enables you to :
- Step through a directories full of spam email, 
- View just the email headers or the entire email,
- View each spam email's contents with colour coding
- Select text (such as IP addresses, email addresses, etc) 
  at the click of the mouse button, and add these to a list 
  of unique items (which can be incorporated into a block file), 
- And do various other things.

In addition, to help you process / analyse spam emails, you can :
- Drag and Drop selected files and/or directories of spam 
  email files via Windows Explorer,
- Drag and Drop selected spam email files from inside ZIP files.

and any unique files (with unique drive, directory, and file name)
will be added to the list of files in the program.

You can then step through these, select IP addresses or Email addresses,
and add these to the list of "Interesting (Unique) Items", and this 
list can then be used to create a "block" file on the email server 
that rejects all email from these sources in the future.

The spam email's contents are "colour coded" as follows :
- "Received" tags are coloured blue,
- "Message-Id" tags are coloured green,
- And, finally, any text that is already in the "Interesting Items" 
  list is colour coded red.  This makes it easy to see what is
  already in the "Interesting Items" list.

In addition to the above, you can also use the buttons provided 
in the program to :

*** File List :
- Add all of the files contained in a directory that you select,
- Remove the currently selected file from the list,
- Erase the list of files, and,
- Copy the file list to Window's Clipboard.

*** File Contents :
- Move to the first, previous, next or last file in the list,
- Copy the displayed file's contents to Windows Clipboard,
- Paste data / text from Windows Clipboard (so that you can analyse 
  this as well.  N.B. this does NOT change any file or affect any 
  file's contents.

*** Interesting Items :
- Add the selected text (i.e. the selected file contents) to the 
  list of Interesting (Unique) Items.
- Delete the selected item(s) from the list of Interesting Items.
- Copy the list of Interesting Items to Window's Clipboard.
- Paste a list of items from Window's Clipboard and add these 
  to the list of Interesting (Unique) Items and weed out any 
  duplicates.
- Erase the list of Interesting Items.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete this program
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !

Before deleting the program, you should turn off 
the auto-running of this program under Windows - 
if you have previously enabled it.  Simply, re-select 
the option under the File Menu in the program to 
achieve this.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- More tags / more colour coding options.

- The ability to remove multiple files from the list of files at once.

- Automatic scanning of emails to build a unique list of all of the 
  (for example) IP addresses that they contain.

- Ability to extract ALL email headers from all emails in the list and display
  these is a large text file.

- The ability to auto-save the "Interesting Items" list every nn seconds or 
  every nn adds / deletes.

- The ability to automatically ignore / skip files with certain file extensions. 
  e.g. ignore / skip .EXE, .DLL, etc files.

- The ability to ignore / reject / remove duplicate files by their file name.
  i.e. ignore the drive + directory when determining duplicates.

- The ability to ignore / reject / remove duplicate files by their file contents.
  i.e. ignore the drive + directory + file name when determining duplicates.

- Add in a halt / stop loading this file button - useful if you accidentally add 
  a huge file to the file list.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, 
what feedback I get, etc.


Special Greetings / Thanks to :
-------------------------------

- Murray Hinton came up with the idea of colour coding
  the text that is already in the "Interesting Items" list 
  red while the program was still in the early stages of 
  development.  This was a very "user friendly" enhancement 
  to the program.  Thanks for the suggestion Murray !!  :)


Reviews / Awards / CDs :

                    for review.
                    (52,765 lines of code / comments.)

                    N.B.  Originally, this program was going to be FREEWARE, or 
                    at least FREE for use by CQU staff to help CQU deal with the 
                    mountains of spam that is bombarding their mail servers.
                    However, I've decided to release this program as FREEWARE

                    make it easier to read the tool tips (i.e. bubble help) 
                    on buttons, etc.
                    Carry out final pre-release testing.
