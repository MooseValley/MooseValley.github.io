Introduction :
--------------

Sound Effects SoundBoard runs under the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM).

Sound Effects SoundBoard is a collection of buttons that
play specific sounds, and buttons that play random sounds or
stop all sounds playing.  The sounds included are all FREE,
public domain sounds.  My friends and I havee had a lot of fun
with these sounds, so maybe others will find them funny, useful,
or interesting at work, at home, and with friends.

A Live Demo of the Sound Effects SoundBoard is available on YouTube:
https://youtu.be/zgMNV3npj04

This software will run on ANY operating system that is capable of
running the JVM, including desktops, laptops, and tablets running
Windows, Linux, Unix, etc, such as PCs, Macs, Raspberry PI, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company,
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.


Using this Program :
--------------------

Download and install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for
your machine / OS (if it is not already installed on your machine):

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Extract the contents of the SoundEffectsSoundBoard zip file you
downloaded from my web site to a folder on your machine.

And then, double click on:

	SoundEffectsSoundBoard.jar

icon / file to run the game in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

* Click the sound buttons to play sounds.

* Click the "Play 1 Random" button to play a random sound.

* Click the "Play Many Random" button to play random sounds
sequentially, one after the other, until you click the
"Stop Sounds" button.

* Click the "Modern Life" button to keep playing random sounds
over the top of each other - it is hilarious and sounds a lot
like modern city life.  Umm, if you had a lot of cats around ;)

* Click the "Stop" button to halt playing all sounds.

* Ctrl + Mouse wheel to increase/decrease font size.


Enjoy ! :)


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- More sounds, themes, impersonations, etc.
  (I'd love to do my own Judge Judy sound board, or Arnie sound board,
   but these would cause legal problems).

- Want me to add any sounds ?  They must be free, public domain sounds.
  If so, let me know.  I don't want any copyright issues.

- Ummmm .... anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.
