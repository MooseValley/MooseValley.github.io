Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.1     28-Sep-96   First Public Release.
1.2     29-Sep-96   Improve time format.
1.3     27-Jan-97   Add in Registration functionality.
1.4     24-May-97   Save settings automatically on Windows 95 shutdown 
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Start Minimised if set in Shortcut / settings
                    (Registered Users only).  
                    Improve application startup - size and position 
                    form before user sees it.
1.5     17-Jun-97   Add in Menu items for viewing my Shareware Catalog, 
                    the Readme file, and the Registration Form.
                    Display the current time in red on a black 
                    background to make it look a bit like an LED 
                    clock.  
1.6     11-Jan-98   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (2,600 lines of code / comments.)

1.7   20-Apr-2000   Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's 
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    Fix NT Warning on Shutdown on some PCs.
                    Store the INI settings file in the program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    Add in "Always On Top" functionality - available 
                    from the "File" menu.
                    (5,316 lines of code / comments.)

1.8   17-Apr-2001   This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.
                    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
       This         component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
     Program        furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
     is now         Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
      FREE !!       Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    Release this program as Freeware.
                    (7,669 lines of code / comments.)

1.8b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    The default release of this program is now for Windows 95 / NT
                    or later.  (If you need a Windows 3.x version, let me know).
                    (30,649 lines of code / comments.)

1.9   17-Nov-2003   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (42,730 lines of code / comments.)

1.91  3-Dec-2003    Fix the day of the week display (caused by upgrading to a new 
                    version of Borland Delphi) - thanks Ed for reporting this.
                    Remove the "Please Register" nag - thanks Ed for reporting this.
                    (42,738 lines of code / comments.)

1.92  24-Dec-2003   Cater for (hopefully) all possible combinations of screen fonts and
                    date / time format and window sizes by calculating how high / wide 
                    the current date / time string is and making sure that this fits 
                    comfortably in the main window without any truncation or excess
                    gaps - thanks Ed for reporting this.
                    There are other / more elegant ways to handle this, which I will 
                    implement if this gives you any more problems Ed.
                    (42,848 lines of code / comments.)

1.93  23-Jan-2004   Attempt another fix for the truncation problem that one user was 
                    still experiencing - thanks for persevering Ed.
                    (42,888 lines of code / comments.)
