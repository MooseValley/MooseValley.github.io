Introduction :

ROM ZIP Differences Manager for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, ME, etc.

In a nutshell, ROM ZIP Differences Manager can :

- automatically extract the files that are different between all 
  changed ROM sets, and,

- automatically apply these differences to existing ROM sets.

This means that you can extract all ROM ZIP differences with a few 
mouse clicks and within seconds / minutes (depending on files sizes).

And, this also means that you can apply all differences to update 
your ROMS with a few mouse clicks and have all your ROMs updated 
within seconds / minutes (depending on files sizes).

This should certainly speed up the generation and application of 
Fix Files, and it should also improve the quality and effectiveness
of Fix Files.

It could also save Joe Public many mega-bytes of downloads a year,
and help with what was previously a nightmarish, manual job of 
using "Fix Files" to update your existing ROM sets.

This program is Freeware.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.


Why I wrote this Program / Why use this Program :
-------------------------------------------------

Whenever a new release of MAME comes out, usually a dozen or 
several dozen games that previously worked fine suddenly no 
longer work - errors have been found in the ROMs by the MAME 
Development team or others, and the ROMs - usually just 1 or 2 
for each game's set - have been re-dumped or fixed.

But, even though only 1 or 2 ROMs changed out of a set of many ROMS
(of maybe a dozen or more) for a game, it is usually necessary to
download the entire game's ZIP file again to get the game to work 
with the new version of MAME.

Some people out there are nice enough to build "Fix Files" 
(such as: Till's "Fix Files" at http://www.sys2064.com/fixfiles.htm), 
which contain the changed ROMs for many of the affected games.

The problem with these "Fix Files" is that :

1.  They usually only fix some of the games that are now broken 
    under the new release of MAME.  

2.  And, from what Till has told me, these "Fix Files" are manually 
    generated - by laboriously comparing ROM CRCs by hand.

3.  In addition, there seems to be no easy way to apply these 
    "Fix Files" to the existing ROMs to fix / update them to
     work with the new version of MAME.  (You have to manually ZIP 
     the changes into each game's ZIP file by hand).

Drum Roll Please ...

This is where ROM ZIP Differences Manager comes in.

In a nutshell, ROM ZIP Differences Manager can :

- automatically extract the files that are different between all 
  changed / updated ROM sets, and,

- automatically apply these differences to existing ROM sets.

I wrote this program especially to save time, hassle, and excess 
downloads.

Various tutorials / walkthroughs of the program are contained below to
show you how to use the program and understand the program better.

Please take the time to read these tutorials / walkthroughs - 
especially if you are new to using this program.

If you do use this program, please send me an email and let me know.
If you like, I will also email you when new versions of the program
are released.  If I know people are using the program, then I am 
more likely to enhance it further in the future.

If you like this program, check out some of my other arcade emulation
utilities, such as :

  - MAME 32 Tools
  - ROM Chopper
  - ROM Clone Zip Manager

or some of the other Freeware / Shareware on my WEB site.


Installing this Program :
-------------------------

To install  this program, simply unzip the contents of the 
distribution ZIP file to a directory (using PKUNIP, WinZIP, 
or similar), run the ROM_Zip_Manager.EXE, and click on the 
buttons to perform the activities you require.

Everything is hopefully clearly labeled and the program 
should hopefully be fairly straight forward to use.

This program does not need any DAT files or other files to work.

It works by comparing CRC's inside each game's ZIP file - no other 
programs or data files are needed (apart from the ROM Differences
"Fix Files" if you are Rebuilding ROM ZIPs).


Uninstalling this Program :
----------------------------

To uninstall this program, simply locate the directory where
you installed it (above) - using Windows Explorer or similar,
and delete the entire directory.

This program does not store anything in the Window's Registry
or in any other directory on your PC.


Using this Program - Pt 1:  Generating ROM Differences
--------------------------

OK, I will talk about this with lots of examples, and
I'll try and keep things as simple as possible.

Let's say that you have your MAME ROM ZIPs stored in 
this directory :

    c:\mame\roms\

and you have just installed a new version of MAME and found
that all of a sudden 10 or so games don't work anymore.

Let's assume that you have now re-dumped / re-downloaded
all of the ROMS for these 10 games and stored their ZIP 
files in another directory, for example :

    c:\mame\roms\new\

So, this directory should contain the complete new sets for 
each new or altered game - even though only 1 or 2 files 
inside each game's ZIP file may have changed.

Now, you can compare the ROMs so that you can generate game 
differences (called "Fix Files") so that you can gives these 
differences to others to save them re-dumping / re-downloading 
many MegaBytes of games again.

In ROM ZIP Differences Manager, on the "Generate Differences" tab,
you would use these settings :

        ROM Directory  : c:\mame\roms\
        New ROM Dir    : c:\mame\roms\new\
   ZIP Differences Dir : c:\mame\roms\diffs\

And, then press the "Compare ZIPs" button, and it will generate
the differences between the new and old ROMs - for every ROM in 
the New ROM Directory.

If a ROM is brand new - i.e. there is no matching file in the 
Old ROM Directory - then it will be skipped.  Only matching 
pairs of ROMs are processed.

When the processing is completed, an "00Readme.txt" file will be 
written to the ZIP Differences Directory containing a brief summary :
ROM ZIP Differences Manager version, date, time, etc.

As an example, let's say the game XYZ has changed, and a new 
ROM had been added to the ZIP file (aaa.bin) and another ROM
inside the ZIP file (bbb.bin) has changed for the new release 
of MAME.  In this case, the ZIP Differences Directory would
contain these files :  
	c:\mame\roms\diffs\xyz\aaa.bin
	c:\mame\roms\diffs\xyz\bbb.bin

That is, the ZIP Differences Directory contains the differences 
between matching (old and new) ZIP files.

These differences could then be ZIPped up and given to others to
save them re-dumping / re-downloading many MegaBytes of 
games again.

Potentially, only one person in the Arcade Emulation Community
would need to do the hard work of :
 - downloading complete ZIP files for all changed games, and, 
 - Generating ROM Differences.

In the past, Till has been nice enough to provide such 
"Fix Files" at http://www.sys2064.com/fixfiles.htm. 

If you are lucky enough to find individual fix files for a game,
such as XYZ_fix.zip, then you could unZIP these to the Extraction 
Directory.  In the case of a fix file for the game XYZ, these 
should be unziped to :

	c:\mame\roms\diffs\xyz\

Unfortunately, though, it is far more common for complete ZIP
files to be made available - so you need to download the entire
game again - than for individual fix files for a game to be made 
available.

The Generating ROM Differences process may take seconds or 
minutes depending on the size of files involved.


Using this Program - Pt 2:  Rebuilding ROM ZIPs
--------------------------

Extending the above example, let's say someone has given us the ROM
Differences all ZIPped up in say a file called : MAME_new.ZIP.

Or, these differences may be in multiple ZIP files.

The first thing to do is unZIP these ZIP file(s) to a directory, 
such as :

     c:\mame\roms\diffs\

and this should then extract files to their own sub-directories for 
each changed game, for example :

	c:\mame\roms\diffs\xyz\aaa.bin
	c:\mame\roms\diffs\xyz\bbb.bin
	::: etc for other games / files :::

where XYZ is the name of a game with a ZIP file XYZ.ZIP, etc
for all other differences / files for other games.

In ROM ZIP Differences Manager, on the "Rebuild ZIPs" tab,
you would use these settings :

        ROM Directory  : c:\mame\roms\
   ZIP Differences Dir : c:\mame\roms\diffs\

Then, all we need to do is press the "Rebuild ZIPs" button,
and ROM ZIP Differences Manager will apply the differences
to the existing ROM set ZIPs.  i.e. it will add the new / changed 
ROMs to the existing game ZIP files in the ROMs Directory.

That is, in mathematical terms :

    New Game ZIP  =  Old Game ZIP  +  Differences

The Rebuild process may take seconds or minutes depending
on the size of files involved.


Using this Program - Pt 3:  Multiple ROM Directories
--------------------------

OK, now we come to the question "What happens if I
keep my ROM ZIP files in Multiple Directories ?".

I certainly do this with my ROMs.  For example, I have 
my ROMs split up alphabetically into directories like :
      c:\mame\roms\a-e\
      c:\mame\roms\f-l\
      c:\mame\roms\m-r\
      c:\mame\roms\s-z\

and put my BIOS files (neogeo.zip, etc) here :
      c:\mame\roms\

If you split up your ROMs into multiple directories, then
you simply need to add each ROM directory to the list of 
ROM directories, or drag and drop directories onto the
ROM Directory listbox (from within Windows Explorer).

The "Compare ZIPs" button and the "Rebuild ZIPs" button 
will then process these multiple directories as required.

Check out the screen shots on my web page for examples
of the program in action.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Add in Error Checking and Validation.
  This program assumes - for the sake of performance - that :
    * all of your ZIP files are error free, 
    * there is enough harddisk space on your PC to ZIP, extract, 
      and re-ZIP files, 
    * your harddisk has no errors, 
    * etc, etc.

  i.e. This program currently does very little verification or 
  validation or error checking.

- Add support for Renamed ROM Sets - at the moment, you will need to 
  manually rename ROM sets - or use some other program - before you 
  can Generate Differences or Rebuild ZIPs.

- Display better progress information : estimated time, start 
  time, time remaining, etc during processing.

- Add support for Compressing Extracted files into a single BIG ZIP 
  file - or a series of ZIP chunked ZIP files (to ensure the space 
  of each ZIP file does not exceed say 1 MB).

- Support for Rebuilding ZIPs (i.e. updating game ZIPs with difference 
  files) from inside a single BIG ZIP file - or a series of ZIP chunked 
  ZIP files.  i.e. the differences dfon't need to be extracted from
  the differences ZIP file before they can be applied to existing game 
  ZIPs.

- Display the MAME 32 version number and details.

- Who knows, maybe even a Linux version (when I can get Delphi / Kylix 
  for Linux and actually get around to installing Linux on one of my PCs).

- Support for Command Line Parameters - so it can be run from the DOS
  command line (while Windows is running).

- Add in options to allow the user to extract all files that are 
  new or have changed in :
   * the New Directory's ZIP files.
     (This program currently only does this !)
   * the Old and New Directory's ZIP files (so you get differences 
     both ways).

- Add in an options to allow the user to :
   * Only process matching ZIP files - i.e. where a ZIP file with the 
     same name exists in both the Old and New Directories.  
     (This program currently only does this !)
   * Move Zip files that are in the New Directory but not the Old 
     Directory to the Extraction Directory.

- This program does NOT generate CRCs - it simply uses the ones available 
  in the ZIP file's header information for each file in the ZIP file.
  This means that processing is much faster.  But could this cause problems ?
  Can the CRCs reported by the zip file be wrong ?  Are ZIP file CRCs -
  even those generated on other hardware and OS's - always 100% compatible 
  with WinZIP / MAME CRC's ?  (As far as I know, the answer to these 
  questions is No, No, and Yes - so there should be no problems here).

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, or would like to give me some feedback on the program,
please email me and let me know.


Special Greetings / Thanks to :
-------------------------------

Special thanks to all arcade emulator authors, people who maintain 
arcade emulator sites, those who buy PCBs and dump the ROMs, and those
who work hard to try and preserve the actual physical arcade machines.
I'd especially like to thank :

- Dave Spicer for developing Sparcade - the very first Arcade Emulator 
  for PCs, which introduced me to Arcade Emulation way back in 1995.
- Nicola Salmoria (for MAME and other emulators) and the fabulous MAME 
  and various MAME 32 Development Teams.
- Neil Bradley (Emu, Retrocade and others).
- Antiriad and the Raine Development Team.
- Dave (Final Burn).
- Anders Nilsson & Janne Korpela (Neo Rage and Tutankham emus).
- Thierry Lescot (System 16 Emulator).
- Neill Corlett (MGE).

- All arcade and other emulator developers - you guys rule !!!
- Virtu Al, Brian Peek, MAME DK, and others - you guys rule too !!!
- Till for his great "Fix Files" at http://www.sys2064.com/fixfiles.htm 

In 1995, I was completely blown away by arcade emulation - and I 
still am !!

Even though some of the above emulators are no longer under 
development, your amazing work is NOT forgotten (or deleted) !!


Program License / Limitations / Restrictions :
----------------------------------------------

There is no trial period and there is no "cut-down" or 
"restricted" functionality that requires users to register.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

0.001  18-Sep-2001  *** Private VERY EARLY BETA Release
                    Very early Private BETA sent to MAKE DK for review 
                    and comment.  I offered to give the program to MAME DK 
                    to save them significant bandwidth costs - they could 
                    have offered ROM FIX files to save people downloading
                    entire ROM sets again when a few ROMs changed.
                    Sadly, they did not bother to reply to my emails.
                    In early March 2002, MAME DK closed down for the second 
                    and perhaps final time because their bandwidth costs 
                    were so high.  If only they had listened to my advice 
                    and took the FREE help I offered ....

0.9B  26-May-2002   *** Private BETA Release
                    Resurrected this project recently after catching up the 
                    3 releases of MAME that I was behind - very hard work ! ;)
                    Email Till who generates "Fix Files" at 
                    http://www.sys2064.com/fixfiles.htm, and let him know
                    about the project, and later on email him a Private BETA of
                    the program to test against the next release of MAME (v0.61).
                    (28,431 lines of code / comments.)

0.9d  29-May-2002   *** Private BETA Release
                    Add in Multi-Directory support - to save you changing 
                    directory and pressing the "Compare ZIPs" or "Rebuild 
                    ZIPs" buttons  multiple times if you have multiple ROM
                    directories.  e.g. c:\roms\a-e\, c:\roms\f-l\, etc.
                    Ensure a '\' terminates all directory paths.
                    Email the new version to Till.
                    (28,481 lines of code / comments.)

0.9e  03-June-2002  *** Private BETA Release
                    Add Drag and Drop support, so you can now drag and drop a
                    single directory onto the ZIP Differences Directory or the
                    New ROM Directory edit boxes, or you can drag and drop
                    one or more directories onto the ROM Directory(s) listbox.
                    Add in a "Reset the ROM Directory list" speedbutton.
                    Add extra validation.  e.g. display a warning message if 
                    the ZIP Differences Directory is the same as the New ROM 
                    Directory, or if the ZIP Differences Directory is in the 
                    list of ROM Directories, etc.
                    (28,780 lines of code / comments.)

                    (28,798 lines of code / comments.)

1.1   20-Nov-2002   Improve various messages / dialogs.
                    Verify the ZIP file is a valid ZIP file before doing 
                    any subsequent processing or testing.
                    Add in Savings Report functionality / tab.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
