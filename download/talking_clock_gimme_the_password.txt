The passwords for Talking Clock's sound packs are, as my 
WEB page clearly says, "For Registered Users Only".

Until you are a registered user, then you will not be provided 
with the passwords to my speech packs under any circumstances.

When you are a registered user, I will supply the passwords to 
unlock all of the sound / speech packs.

Talking Clock is well worth registering and for $20 Australian 
(about $10 US) you get :
- an excellent, fun, and useful program
- access to a great set of sounds : Mrs Doubtfire, Yoda, Clint Eastwood, 
  Sean Connery, etc.
- FREE upgrades for life !
- FREE Technical Support via Email.
- Access to the latest functionality - only available in Registered 
  versions of my programs.
- Friendly and fast customer support via Email.
- Notifications by Email when the programs you have registered are upgraded.
- Greater say in future changes / enhancements.
- A big thank you from me !

A great deal of work has gone into Talking Clock and the Sound Packs.

Taking all of this into account, I am sure that you will agree that my 
software is very good value for money.

In 5 years, between January 1997 and February-2002, less than 30 copies 
of Talking Clock have been sold in total, and most of these sales were 
back when the program was just $5.  i.e. before the price rise.

Taking this into account, you should understand that the many dozens of 
hours of work I have done on this program and sound packs have earned me 
less than a few Australian dollars per hour.  (I am not complaining - 
just stating a fact).

Asking you to register the program is not being greedy, it is simply
being reasonable.  I am certainly not becoming "filthy rich" from my 
work.

I hope to receive your registration soon.
