Introduction :
--------------

Video SubTitle Tools provide functionality to covert subtitle files
(SRT, SBV, and Echo 360 XML) to a plain text transcript.

This software will run on ANY operating system that is capable of
running the JVM, including desktops, laptops, and tablets running
Windows, Linux, Unix, etc, such as PCs, Macs, Raspberry PI, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company,
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.


Using this Program :
--------------------

Download and install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for
your machine / OS (if it is not already installed on your machine):

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Extract the contents of the VideoSubTitleTools.zip file you
downloaded from my web site to a folder on your machine.

And then, double click on:

	VideoSubTitleTools.jar

icon / file to run the software in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

You can drag and drop subtitle files onto VideoSubTitleTools using
Windows Explorer.  Or paste the subtitle data in from the Clipboard.
Or click the "Open" button and select a subtitle file to process.

Check / set the options you want.  The following are available.

* Remove HTML/XML: remove all HTML and Echo 360 XML tags
from the subtitle file.
Some subtitle files include HTML to colour the subtitle text,
or to make the subtitle text itallic or bold:
	<font color ...> ... </font>
	<I> ... </I>
	<B> ... </B>
	<U> ... </U>

* Remove Scene Setters: remove all "scene setters" from the
subtitle file.  Scene setters are text contained within square
brackets [] to add explanation or describe the mood.  For example:

	[Cheerful instrumental music]

* Remove Counters: remove all counters from the text.  i.e. remove
all lines that contain just a number.
For example, remove the "1" in the example below.

* Remove TimeStamps: remove all time stamps and time durations from the subtitle file.
For example, remove the "00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,600":

	1
	00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,600
	On this shipwrecked episode
	of Mythbusters...

* Remove Blank Lines: remove all blank lines.

* Combine All Lines: combine all lines of text into a single paragraph.
Bullet points (lines starting with *, -, +) are always placed on a new line.


When you have the settings set the way you want, click the "Convert"
button to process the selected subtitle file (in the "Source" area)
and display the converted data in the "Results" area.

Feel free to explore. :)  You can change settings and click the
"Convert" button to see the results and keep trying options
until you get the results you like best.  :)

Click the "Save" button to save the results.


Sample Conversion :
-------------------

The subtitle source data file (for about 12 seconds of an episode
of Mythbusters S6 Ep187 - Duct Tape Island Survival):

Note: I have added additional HTML tags and items for illustration purposes.


1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,600
On this shipwrecked episode
of Mythbusters...

[Cheerful instrumental music]
2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,040
<font color = #FFFF00>Jamie and I attempt to survive</font>
<font color = #FFFF00>on a deserted island</font>

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,520
<font color = #FFFF00>with nothing but a pallet</font>
<font color = #FFFF00>of duct tape.</font>

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,680
That's right,
it's <B>duct tape versus wild</B>

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,400
in the <U>most <I>extraordinary</I>
survival challenge in history</U>.


The converted transcript text:

On this shipwrecked episode of Mythbusters... Jamie and I attempt to
survive on a deserted island with nothing but a pallet of duct tape.
That's right, it's duct tape versus wild in the most extraordinary
survival challenge in history.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Convert subtitle files between formats: SBV, SRV, XML, etc.

- More conversion to transcript options - let me know if
  you need anything !  :)

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
