Introduction :
--------------

Binary Clock is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Binary Clock is a "for fun" program that displays a re-sizable
binary clock - that is, a clock where the time is displayed 
via the binary number system (base 2) instead of the 
decimal number system (base 10).

A whole range (in fact, some people would probably say 
"a whole overkill") of settings, graphics, and options 
are available via the settings menu.

The normal Windows style menus are turned off in this program
(so they don't detract from the clock), however, everything 
can be accessed via a right mouse click popup menu.

N.B.  I have throttled this program back to use negligible 
      CPU and machine resources.  Even on my ancient  
      Pentium II 300 MHz PC (from 1998), this program is 
      barely even a "blip" on its "to do" list.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
---------------------------

I wrote this program because my interest in Binary Clocks
was rekindled after reading some forum postings on the
Atomic Maximum Power Computing Magazines website :

http://www.atomicmpc.com.au/forums.asp?s=2&c=9&t=4595

where loads of my fellow geeks were salivating to buy 
a physical, hardware binary clock - which was for sale 
for about $60 Australian dollars (inc postage from the US).

Unlike such hardware based Binary Clocks, my software 
Binary Clock will *never* wear out.

And, my software Binary Clock is a hell of a lot cheaper, 
and it can be with you whenever working on a computer.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\Clock\ - and run the executable 
file : Binary_Clock.EXE.

Then, you can right-mouse click on the program's main window
and a Pop-Up Menu will appear, allowing you to go to the
"Settings" screen, or choose from a whole range of options,
such as :
- Always On Top
- Auto-Run at Windows Startup
- Restore Factory Defaults
- View Readme File
- View Shareware Catalog
- About ...  (i.e. about this program).
- Exit (this program).

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete Binary Clock
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !

Before deleting the program, you should turn off 
the auto-running of this program under Windows - 
if you have previously enabled it.  Simply, re-select 
the option under the Right-Mouse Click "Pop-Up Menu" 
in the program to achieve this.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Better graphics ....  ???

- Get some good LED graphics ...

- If Number of Runs = 0, then display a message to the user to make 
  sure that they know about the right-mouse click popup menu.

- Vertical or horizontal or diagonal (!?!) clock layout. 

- Add another option to display the time as a label at the bottom of the screen
  (instead of HHMMSS, etc)

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Freeware Information :
-----------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0  17-Nov-2003    First Public Release.
                    (57,473 lines of code / comments.)

                    17/Nov/2003 2:20 PM : Announced the project on 
                    Atomic Magazine's Tech Talk Forum :

                    http://www.atomicmpc.com.au/forums.asp?s=2&c=9&t=4682&m=46505

                    and encounter an absolute firestorm of abuse from
                    the cretins that lurk in these forums.

1.1  3-Dec-2003     If the user left-mouse clicks on the programs window, then  
                    automatically go to the Settings screen.
                    More configuration options.  e.g. enable the user to 1 column 
                    (instead of 2) for each hours, minutes, seconds, etc by
                    selecting the new time formats H:M, H:M:S, etc.
                    (This uses 6 bits to represent 59 minutes or seconds - 2^6 = 64).
