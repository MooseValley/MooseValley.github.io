Introduction :
--------------

Money Or The Case is a simple game that runs under the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM).

Money Or The Case is my game based on games and game shows like
'Pick a Card', 'Deal or No Deal', 'Pick a Box',
'The Money or The Box', ... and ofcourse is just for fun.

How to Play:
* Click the 'Start' button to start a new game.
* Select 'your' case.
* One by one, select the required number of cases for the round.
* At the end the round decide whether to accept the
  offer or play on to the next round.
* If there are 2 cases left, then select one of the cases.

Needless to say, all money / winnings in this game are
'funny money'.

This game will run on ANY operating system that is capable of
running the JVM, including desktops, laptops, and tablets running
Windows, Linux, Unix, etc, such as PCs, Macs, Raspberry PI, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company,
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

such as :
