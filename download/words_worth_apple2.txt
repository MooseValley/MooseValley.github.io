This ZIP file contains a disk image of my original 
Words Worth Crossword And Scrabble Companion  
Apple ][ floppy disk - a program I wrote way back 
in 1982 on my Apple ][ computer.

This Apple ][ version is FREEWARE - please feel free to copy 
it, distribute it, and use it in any way you like.

Words Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion
provides some basic functionality that might be useful
to people who like playing scrabble, or doing crosswords, 
or anyone who needs to look up words or use words in 
other ways.

This program is *extremely* limited :

- Only very basic word searching functionality is 
  provided.

- In addition, a list of only 938 words are provided -
  but you can add more yourself using the "Add"
  function in the program.

I typed all of these words in by hand over several weeks
in 1982 - what a hellish job that was !!

Two versions of the program are provided :
- AppleSoft BASIC version
- and a much faster Machine Code version

You can run whichever version you like.


Using this Program :
---------------------

Unzip the disk image to wherever you have installed your 
favourite Apple 2 emulator, and you can then run it with 
the emulator.

designed for use by tournament crossword and scrabble players.
