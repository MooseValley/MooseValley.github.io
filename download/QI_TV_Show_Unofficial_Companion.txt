Introduction:
-------------

QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, 
netbooks, etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which 
includes Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

NOTE: To avoid Copyright issues, no copyrighted material is provided with 
this program.  See "Trademarks and COPYRIGHT Information" below for further details.

QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion is for fans of the TV show QI, and will help 
you really get the most out of QI by providing the following functionality:

* Find episodes by keyword(s) and/or panelist and then watch the selected 
  episode by simply double clicking on the episode name.
  See "NOTES" below and "Installing / Setting up this Program" below.

* Watch episodes of QI in a window or full screen, with or without subtitles, 
  automatically skipping opening credits / music, etc.
  See "NOTES" below and "Installing / Setting up this Program" below.

* Search through episode transcripts / sub-title / keyword index files and display a 
  list of episodes that contain the keywords.  
  If the Transcript files are on your computer, then the sentences / phrases where each 
  word appears will be displayed.
  If the Sub-title files are on your computer, then the sentences / phrases where each 
  word appears will be displayed along with the time-stamp (the location in the episode).
  If you double click on any search results lines with a time stamp, then the video 
  will jump to that location and play the episode from that point forward.
  See "NOTES" below and "Installing / Setting up this Program" below.

* If you have sub-title files for episodes, then QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion 
  will automatically use these when you do a search, and you double click on a 
  particular line in the search results, and the video will jump directly to that point
  and play the episode from that point on.
  See "NOTES" below and "Installing / Setting up this Program" below.

* See a list of episodes that each panelist appeared,

* Select multiple panelists to see which episodes they appeared in together,

* See photos of every panelist that has appeared on the show to remind you who they are.
  See "Trademarks and COPYRIGHT Information" below.

* Watch any episode by simply double clicking on the episode in any of the lists 
  (if you have the video files stored on your harddrive).

* See various statistics about QI, such as the ratio of men / women on the show, 
  who appeared most on the show, and so on.

* If the "Auto Search for episode on YouTube if not found" checkbox on the Settings 
  tab is checked, then automatically search for episodes on YouTube if they cannot 
  be found locally on your computer.  No need to have *any* episodes stored 
  locally on your computer.  (Make sure you have lots of spare internet bandwidth).

* And more ...

The program keeps track of which episodes you have watched and colour codes these 
(blue by default, but you can change this to whatever colour you want) so you can 
tell at a glance which episodes you have watched.  If you want to reset / erase 
your watching history, then click the "Reset" button for your history on the 
"Watchers" tab.

If you have multiple people using the same computer, then you can add multiple people
to the Watchers tab and they each have their own individual viewing history.
Just click on the name in the list to change the person watching.

The program colour codes episodes whose videos it cannot find red by (default).

You can change the colours used for colour coding on the "Settings" tab.

Macintosh, Android, Linux, iPad, etc version(s) are planned for the future.  
See "The Future" below.

NOTE: I very highly recommend that you watch my setup, installation, and usage video:

Trademarks and COPYRIGHT Information:
-------------------------------------

QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion is UNOFFICIAL software.
It is NOT officially endorsed by the copyright holders

NOTE: 
* NO COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL IS PROVIDED WITH THIS PROGRAM !

All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

To avoid Copyright issues, the following are NOT supplied with this program
(and they are NOT available from my web site):
* Episode Videos 
* Panelist Photos
* Episode Sub-title files 
* Episode Transcript files
* Episode Questions / Answers
* Episode sounds / music

Why ?  I do NOT want to get in trouble with the copyright holders or anyone else.  
Do NOT ask me for these items, because I will NOT supply them to anyone.

Despite numerous attempts, I could not obtain the permission from the 
copyright holders to include any other material.

QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion is severely limited because I could not 
get permission to include any of the above items with my program.

Sorry, you will have to find the above information / photos / etc elsewhere.

Keyword Index (.ind) files are supplied with this program.  These consist of an 
alphabetical list of the words that appear in each episode (where available).  
Such keyword files NOT Copyrighted material, because you cannot copyright a 
simple list of words.

If you want the episode videos, buy the QI DVDs (if available - only some 
seasons have been released at the time of writing).  Or you could watch / 
record the program on TV (only if legal), or search on YouTube (only if 
legal) - most (all ?) of the episodes seem to be on YouTube ??

Separate ZIP files may be provided on my web site for episode transcripts or 
panelist photos.  If these are provided, then they will be provided in ZIP files 
separately from my program.

Panelist photos and episode transcripts are freely available on the internet, 
so if this information is provided on my web page, then this will be provided 
out of good faith and all I have done is gather the information and provide 
a single source for it to save others the effort of doing this for themselves.


Installing / Setting up this Program:
-------------------------------------

NOTE: I very highly recommend that you watch my setup, installation, and usage video:
* QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion - v1.0f
  http://youtu.be/DBNON13WJL0

To install this program, download the ZIP file QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion 
from my web site to your PC, and UnZip the program to a directory on your PC 
with all folders intact.  e.g. You could UnZip the program to:

c:\QI TV Show\

and if you extracted the ZIP file with folders intact, then there will be a series of
sub-folders below this directory.

	Indexes
	Photos
	Settings
	Sounds
	Videos

If these don't exist, then you have extracted the ZIP file incorrectly (without folders).
Do it again and properly this time !  :)

* Panelist Photos:

NOTE: I could NOT include panelist photos with QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion.
See "Trademarks and COPYRIGHT Information" above.
You will need to create / find these yourself.

If you want to be able to see the photos of the panelists when you click 
on them, then these need to be contained in any of the "Panelist Photos"
folders specified on the "Settings" tab.  e.g. the "Photos" folder 
created when you extracted the QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion ZIP file above.
The photos need to have a specific name, as follows:

	panelist name.jpg
	
e.g. "Alan Davies.jpg"	(without the quotes).


* Transcripts / sub-title / keyword files:

NOTE: I cannot supply subtitle (SRT), transcript (TXT), or episode 
summary (NFO) files with QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion.
See "Trademarks and COPYRIGHT Information" above.

However, I have included ALL of the Keyword Index (IND) files I have with 
QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion.  These files are contained in the "Indexes" 
folder when you UnZIP QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion.  I have been able to 
include these Keyword Index files because they are NOT Copyrighted material - 
no-one can copyright a simple list of words.

These Keyword Index (IND) files consist of an alphabetical list of the 
words that appear in each episode (where available).  Some episodes 
are missing keyword files because I do not have the information 
(subtitle SRT or transcript TXT file) to build / construct the 
Keyword Index (IND) files.  (And I have not had time to watch the 
episode and type in this information by hand).  Maybe you can help ?  
See "Can YOU Help ?" below.

If you want to be able to search through episode transcripts / sub-title / 
keyword index files then these need to be contained in any of the 
"Transcripts / Sub-titles / Key word files" folders specified on the 
"Settings" tab.  e.g. "Indexes" folder created when you extracted the 
QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion ZIP file above.

These files need to follow a very flexible naming convention starting with 
"QI" and containing the "episode name" and having a .srt, .txt, .nfo, 
.ind file extension.  So, for example, for the "Kris Kringle" episode, 
ALL of the following are valid names:
	QI Kris Kringle.ind					(or .srt or .txt or .nfo)
	QI Series K Episode 14 Kris Kringle.ind			(or .srt or .txt or .nfo)
	QI - S11,E14 - Kris Kringle (Christmas Special).ind	(or .srt or .txt or .nfo)
	QI Series11 Ep14 Kris Kringle Christmas.ind		(or .srt or .txt or .nfo)

By convention I have used these file extensions for Transcripts / sub-title / 
keyword files:
* SRT are subtitle files which have time stamps for each section of dialog.
* TXT are transcript files
* NFO are summaries of the episode.
* IND are keyword index files - an alphabetical list of the words that 
  appear in each episode.

QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion will search through each of the 
"Transcripts / Sub-titles / Key word files" folders you specify on the 
"Settings" tab and look for the files in the above order, that is:
SRT, TXT, NFO, IND.  For example, if it can find a SRT file for the episode 
then it will use this for the search.  If no SRT can be found, then it will 
then look for a TXT file for the episode, and if none can be found, move 
onto NFO, and finally IND.


* Videos

If you want to be able to double click on episodes and play them / watch 
them, then:

(1). the videos need to be contained in any of the "Episode Videos"
folders specified on the "Settings" tab.  These files need to follow 
a very flexible naming convention starting with "QI" and containing 
the "episode name" and having a .mp4, .avi, or .mpg file extension.  
So, for example, for the "Kris Kringle" episode, ALL of the following 
are valid names:
	QI Kris Kringle.mp4					(or .avi or .mpg)
	QI Series K Episode 14 Kris Kringle.mp4			(or .avi or .mpg)
	QI - S11,E14 - Kris Kringle (Christmas Special).mp4	(or .avi or .mpg)
	QI Series11 Ep14 Kris Kringle Christmas.mp4		(or .avi or .mpg)

(2). Or, if the "Auto Search for episode on YouTube if not found" checkbox 
on the "Settings" tab is checked, then QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion will 
search on YouTube for the episode video if it cannot be found on your computer.  
This search will display a list of episodes on YouTube (if any) and you can click 
on whichever one you want to watch.


* Sounds folder

If the "Sounds" folder contains a sound file called:

	QI_Intro_music_clip_wav_SOUND.wav

Then this sound will be played whenever the program starts-up or whenever the 
Watcher is changed.

NOTE: I could NOT include any sounds with QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion.
See "Trademarks and COPYRIGHT Information" above.
You will need to create / find these yourself.


* Settings tab:

On the Settings tab you can set the folders that QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion 
will look in for videos, panelist photos, and transcripts / indexes / subtitles.

Also, if VLC (VideoLan, http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) is installed on your 
PC and VLC is selected as the default video player on the Settings tab, then 
the following "VLC (VideoLan) Options for Playing Episodes" settings are 
available on the Settings tab:
- "Full Screen": if checked, VLC/VideoLan will play videos in Full Screen,
- Subtitles (if available): display sub-titles if they are available (the .srt 
  file for the episode is stored with the video on your harddrive).
- "Skip seconds at beginning": if checked, then skip the 1st 30 seconds (or 
  whatever value is entered in the little data entry box) of each episode 
  (great for skipping the opening music / credits), 
- "Always on Top": if checked, episodes will be played by VLC/VideoLan
  on top of all other windows,

On this tab you can also select the colours used to highlight missing videos and 
watched episodes.

If "Play sound when loading viewing history" is checked, and a sound file called
"QI_Intro_music_clip_wav_SOUND.wav" is in the "sounds\" folder, then this sound file 
will be played when QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion starts up and whever the "Watcher" 
is changed.

If "Auto Search for episode on YouTube if not found is checked, then 
QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion will open your default web browser and search 
for the episode video on the YouTube web site if you attempt to play an 
episode's video and the video cannot be found in any of the nominated 
video folders.


* Audits tab:

OK, if you are still with me, click the "Audit" button, and 
QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion will check the directories / folders 
you have specified in the Settings tab, and list what items you 
are missing in each of these categories:
- Panelist Photos
- Keyword Indexes (IND)
- Episodes (MP4, AVI, MPG)
- Episode Transcripts (TXT) or Subtitle (SRT) files.


Finally, I very highly recommend that you install VLC/VideoLan 
(http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) on your computer if it isn't 
already.  See Note #2 in "NOTES" above.


Using this Program:
-------------------

NOTE: I very highly recommend that you watch my setup, installation, and usage video:
* QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion - v1.0f
  http://youtu.be/DBNON13WJL0

To use QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion, unzip it to a directory on your harddrive 
(with folders intact), etc - see "Installing / Setting up this Program" above. 

Once installed / setup, run / double click the EXE:

	QI_TV_Show_Unofficial_Companion.exe

* Watchers tab:

If you have multiple people using the same computer, then you will want to 
set-up a watcher for each person.  e.g. you might have 3 Watchers: Moose, 
Frankie, Murray.  The currently selected watcher is displayed in big letters 
when QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion starts-up, and also in the program's 
title bar.

On the Watchers tab you can Add and Delete watchers, and select the current watcher.
Once selected, you can, if you want, click the "Reset" button to erase the currently 
selected watchers viewing history - all episodes will become "unwatched".

* Panelists tab:

On the left is a list of all of the panelists and other people who have appeared 
on the show, including specials, making of documentaries, compilation shows, etc.
This list includes the QI Elves, because they appeared in the "Making of QI" 
documentary.

On the right is a list of all episodes - including the season, episode number, episode name, 
and the people who appeared in that episode.

Click on a Panelist to see their photo - if it can be found in any of the 
"Panelist Photos" folders specified on the "Settings" tab.
See the "Panelist Photos" section in "Installing / Setting up this Program" above. 

If you check / tick one or more panelists, that is, click the little checkbox 
next to their name(s), the you will see the episodes that just the checked 
panelist(s) appeared in.

If you double click on any episodes, then the video for that episode will play 
(if it is on your computer) or YouTube will be searched for the episode.  
See the "Videos" section in "Installing / Setting up this Program" above.


* Searches tab:

You can enter whatever keywords you like, separated by spaces, and then click 
the "Search" button and QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion will search all 
transcripts, sub-title, or keyword files, depending on which of these files 
exist on your computer.  See the "Transcripts / sub-title / keyword files" section 
in "Installing / Setting up this Program" above.

If you double click on any episodes in the search results, then the video for that 
episode will play (if it is on your computer) or YouTube will be searched 
for the episode.  See the "Videos" section in "Installing / Setting up this Program" 
above.

If you have any subtitle files installed on your computer, then you can double click 
on the time stamped subtitle lines in the search results and the selected episode
will play from that point forward.

For example, if the search results included these lines:

QI - S08,E07 - Horrible: Alan Davies, Chris Addison, Dara O'Briain, Sean Lock
* 00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,120 - in the world's nastiest cocktail?
* 00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,120 - We're after a nasty cocktail.
* 00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,080 - It's a genuine cocktail
* 00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,360 - The Sourtoe cocktail is
* 00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,680 - the Sourtoe cocktail,

And I double clicked on the 3rd line:
* 00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,080 - It's a genuine cocktail

then the "QI - S08,E07 - Horrible" episode would play from 8 mins, 42 seconds 
into the video right were the particular search result is being discussed.

This functionality requires VLC/VideoLan to be installed and setup on your computer.
See the "Videos" section in "Installing / Setting up this Program" 
above and Note #2 in "NOTES" above.

* Audits tab:

See "Installing / Setting up this Program" above. 


* Settings tab:

See "Installing / Setting up this Program" above. 


* Statistics tab:

Displays various statistics about QI, such as the ratio of men / women on 
the show, who appeared most on the show, and so on.

If the "Include Compilations, Specials, Unaired Pilot, etc" checkbox is checked, 
then the statistics will include compilations, specials, the Unaired Pilot episode, 
the "Making of QI" documentary, etc.


Further Notes: 
* You can right mouse click on most of the lists, etc in 
QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion and a little popup menu will appear.
Some interesting functionality hidden there, including the ability to edit 
index keyword index files, mark episodes as watched or unwatched, 
copy lists or lines to Windows Clipboard, and much more !  :)


Why I wrote this Program ?
--------------------------

I am a huge fan of the TV show, and so is my mother.  In fact, Mum got me into QI.
I really wrote this program for her !  :)

When discussing the program, with Mum and friends, we would talk about things 
that happened in an episode we watched week(s) ago, and then we would all wonder 
what episodes they were, and we would have no way of finding out.  This is why I 
added the "Keyword Searching" functionality into the program.

I also wondered a lot about panelists.  A friend of mine likes Julian Clary, and he 
asked which episodes Julian Clary appeared in.  I knew he had appeared in at least 
1 episode, but I had no idea which one(s).  With my program, you can select Julian 
(or any other panelist) from the list and see all their episodes.

If you have the video files on your harddrive, then my program will play the 
episode when you double click on it in any of the lists in which it appears.
Or, if the video isn't available, it will search YouTube for the video.
See the "Videos" section in "Installing / Setting up this Program" 
above and Note #2 in "NOTES" above.

We wanted to be able to flag episodes that we have watched, and have separate 
watch lists - so we could each keep track of which episodes we had watched.

All of this functionality makes it very easy to find and watch the episodes.  :)

The following pre-defined search terms are built into the search drop down box so you 
can find some really interesting episodes:
	batman robin life tights
	electrocuted face
	fish louse tongue
	flipperty flop jumpkins
	ghost cow
	koala fingerprints
	mosquitoes london underground
	nastiest cocktail
	nun horn
	radish meat
	straw houses
	tiniest houses europe
	triple point water Dara O'Briain
	seemerot webcam coffin


Can YOU Help ?
--------------

Note: before emailing me, please make sure you are using the *LATEST* 
version of QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion *and* also check my 
web page to see if the missing information has already been supplied 
by someone else:

http://moosevalley.fhost.com.au/mooses_freeware.html#QI_TV_Show_Companion


* Panelist Scores:

Do you have a list of the scores each panelist received in each episode ?
Is this is a nice format ?  Comma or Tab separated ?  Or, better yet, 
in a spreadsheet ?  :)

If so, please email it to me and, I will add support for panelist scores to
QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion and probably also add graphs and trends 
for each panelists scores, so we can see if they are getting smarter or 
"dumber" as time goes by !  ;)  And, graphs to show how each person's score 
compares to the average panelist scores ?


Special Thanks To:
------------------

Special thanks to the following:

(1). John Lloyd (QI creator), Stephen Fry, Alan Davies, the BBC, Talkback Thames, 
Fremantle Media, the QI team, the QI elves, and everyone who is involved with 
or has appeared on the show for creating such a magnificent, interesting, and 
entertaining TV show.  Long may it continue !!  After you have finished all of 
episodes up to Z, I hope you start back at A again and go round again 
(and again) !! :)

(2). Alex Bell (QI Researcher).  Thanks Alex !

(3). ABC for broadcasting QI in Australia so us Aussies can watch it.  :)

(4). Sarah (MinervaMoon)
Web site:  http://sites.google.com/site/qitranscripts/
Sarah's web site contains very comprehensive transcripts, with screen shots of 
the episodes, further background information about discussion topics, errors 
and omissions, references to other episodes (where needed), and much more.  
Very impressive work !  Very well done indeed !  :)

I asked Sarah if I could include her Transcripts with QI TV Show UnOfficial 
Companion and she said "yes", but I was still worried about Copyright issues and 
I didn't want to upset the QI team, the BBC, Talkback Thames, Fremantle Media,
or anyone else.

While none of Sarah's transcripts are included with QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion, 
but I did use about 10 (?) of her transcripts to create keyword index (IND) files.
Thanks Sarah !

(5). Springfield Springfield web site 
Web site: http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/episode_scripts.php?tv-show=qi-2003
The Springfield Springfield web site contains just the bare bones transcripts.

None of the Springfield transcripts are included with QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion, 
but I did use about 12 (?) of their transcripts to create keyword index (IND) files.

(6). Special thanks to all 58 people who watched my demonstration 
video on YouTube for the unreleased prototype version of my 
QI TV Show UnOfficial Companion.

(7). And an extra special thanks to the 1 person who gave my demonstration 
video a "thumbs up" on YouTube !  :)  Thank you whoever you are !!!!!!!!!  :D


The Future:
-----------

I've got LOTS of ideas for this program, but I've got to be careful !
I do NOT want to upset anyone, or cause any issues with copyright holders.

In the future, many improvements *could* be made to this program,
such as:

- Macintosh, Android, Linux, iPad, etc version(s) of this program.
  Anyone want these ?  Let me know !
  Anyone want to help with the development / programming of these ?  
  Let me know !  :)

- QI Quizzes - random questions from selected seasons / episodes, complete 
  with Klaxon sounds and effects when you select a "trap" answer.
  
  *NOTE: Requires permission from the copyright holders.

- Add music, sound effects, snippets of dialog, Stephen Fry's iconic 
  "Good Evening, Good Evening, Good Evening", and so on from the TV show.
  
  *NOTE: Requires permission from the copyright holders.

- Display each panelist's scores for each episode, and calculate their 
  average score across all of their appearances on QI.  
  I haven't added this yet. I've resisted because I know what I'm like .... 
  Once I add in support for the points each player scored per episode, 
  I'll be calculating the highest point scorers, the most frequent winners, 
  the averages points each player achieved, and then I'll be generating 
  graphs of each panelist's score and a trend line showing if they are 
  getting better or worse and a whole host of other stuff. Trying to 
  resist this for now. But maybe it'll happen sooner or later .... 
  Issue, what score would I use ?  Sometimes scores are adjusted years 
  down the track.  If I use their adjusted score, then I'll have people email 
  me complaining that this wasn't the score they actually got at the end 
  of the episode.  If I use the score they got in the episode, I'll have 
  people complaining that this wasn't their final score because their 
  score was adjusted 2 years later (or whatever).
  Example: Dara O'Briain and his "Triple Point of Water" answer(s).  
  REF:
  * QI - S02,E07 - Biscuits          23:05->
  * QI - S09,E10 - Inland Revenue    17:45->

- Search for and build panelist photos from the images freely 
  available all over the internet, Google Images, etc.
  e.g. For Alan Davies, search to Google Images, grab the 1st image, 
  download it, crop it to s specific size, and save it to the "Photos" 
  folder.  Do this automatically for all panelists.
  Anyone want this ?

- Anything else ?  Would you like this program to do something else ?
  Please email me and let me know.  :)

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.  :)

As with ALL of the 90+ software titles I have created and uploaded 
to my web page, how much more work I do on this program depends 
entirely on what feedback / support I get, how many people use 
the program, etc.  If no-one uses or likes the program, then I'm 
hardly likely to invest many dozens of hours porting my code to 
other platforms or building new features into my program ! :)

So, if you use / like this program, please do email me and tell me !  :)
All kind feedback is much appreciated !  :)

100% Virus Free - 55+ Virus Checkers:
------------------------------------
VirusTotal.com is a brilliant and free web service where you can upload 
files and, at the current time, scan them against 57 virus and malware 
scanners. I have been using this service for many years, and nothing 
gets near any of my machines - not even into my temporary sandbox 
areas - unless it at least passes a VirusTotal.com scan with a 
clean bill of health. 

All of my software is scanned on VirusTotal.com and a link to 
the Virus Scan reports is provided on my web page for each of my software 
titles.
