Introduction :
--------------

Yahtzee is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

This is my special version of the fun and highly addictive dice 
game, called Yahtzee.

A wealth of information is provided below to help you play 
Yahtzee and use this program.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
--------------------------------------------

I wrote this program because I thoroughly enjoy playing the 
game Yahtzee, and I was pretty sure that my mother would 
also like playing this game.

The problem was that I couldn't find any really good versions
of the game as shareware or freeware on the internet.

And, because I had written other computer based versions of Yahtzee 
before (in command line, character based C++), it was the right time 
for me to do a nice, polished Windows version of the game.

My version of Yahtzee is a program I have wanted to have for ages.

It has many advanced features - such as High Score Table merging, etc - 
that are NOT found in any other computer version of Yahtzee that 
I can find.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

The steps for using the program are :

- Step 1 : Install the program.

  Unzip the program to a directory on your PC.
  Such as:

    C:\Program Files\Yahtzee\

  Using Windows Explorer, open the directory where you 
  extracted the contents of the ZIP file (above), and 
  copy the dice font file (Yahtzee_Font_TRPGDRG_.TTF) 
  to the Windows Fonts directory, which is usually:

       C:\WINDOWS\FONTS\

- Step 2 : Run the Program :

  Using Windows Explorer, open the directory where you 
  extracted the contents of the ZIP file (in 1. above), and 
  double click on the YAHTZEE.EXE file torun the program.

Now, you are ready to play Yahtzee.  

See "Yahtzee Rules" below for details of how play Yahtzee in general.

To start a new game of Yahtzee, click the "Start Game" button, 
and the dice will automatically be rolled.  You can discard any 
unwanted dice (by clicking on them) and re-roll the dice 
(by clicking the "Roll Dice" button) up to 2 times, select a scoring
category by clicking a button (such as "Ones", "Twos", ....
"3 of a Kind", etc), and then click the "Roll Dice" button to
start your next turn.

N.B.  You can also press the "R" key to re-roll the dice.

To see what the current roll of the dice would score in each available 
category, simply look at the numbers next to each score box.  
(Provided you have "Show Potential Scores in each category"
turned on / checked - see below).

When all scoring categories are filled, the game is over.

Click the "Start Game" button to start a new game.

To help you work with dice, various little buttons are provided 
near the dice (provided you have "Show Dice Invert, Off, On buttons"
turned on / checked - see below).  These buttons are as follows :

 - Invert button turns reverses the selection of the dice.  
   i.e. all dice selected for re-roll and now kept, and all dice that 
   were kept are marked for re-roll.

 - Off button - turns all dice off.  i.e. it selects them all for re-roll.

 - On button - turns all dice on.  i.e. it keeps all dice - none are selected 
   for re-roll.

 - Show previous dice - for this current roll.  Which lets you see what dice 
   you had before the current re-roll and which dice you selected to re-roll.
   I used this button a lot during testing / development, but it was so useful 
   that I decided to leave it "in".

Under the "Edit" menu, you can :

- Change / View Program Settings

  * Sort Dice into Ascending Order ? 
    I much prefer the dice to be sorted, but some people may prefer
    otherwise.  This provides various dice sorting options.

  * Show Dice Values or Faces
    Whether the values of each dice are shown or whether the face of 
    each dice is shown.

  * Show Max Scores for each Total Type
    If this option is "checked" (i.e. turned on) then the maximum Upper, 
    Lower, and Grand Total scores will be displayed in the headings.
    e.g. If checked, then you will "Upper Total (Max=140)", but if 
    this option isn't checked, then you will see "Upper Total".

  * Show Potential Scores in each category
    If this option is "checked" (i.e. turned on) then the score for each
    available scoring category will be shown next to each scoring box.

  * Show Dice Invert, Off, On buttons
    This shows / hides little buttons next to the dice that allow
    you to work with the dice in more advanced ways.  If you don't
    use these features, then you may like to turn them off and 
    reduce some clutter.

  * Enable Game Sounds
    Self explanatory - turns game sounds on or off.  The sounds consist
    of various sounds, some are recordings of my voice, and others are 
    electronic or bird sounds.

- View High Scores
  Self explanatory.

- Merge in another High Score's File  (** Registered Users Only **)
  This option allows Registered users to merge in other high score tables.
  This is very useful if you are playing Yahtzee on multiple computers
  and you want to merge all of these high scores into a single high score table.

- Erase All High Scores               (** Registered Users Only **)
  This option allows Registered users to erase all high scores.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

If you want this program to be "Always On Top" 
of other Windows, then select the "Always On Top"
menu option under the "File" menu.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

Before deleting the program, you should turn off 
the auto-running of this program under Windows - 
if you have previously enabled it.  Simply, run the 
program and re-select the option under the File menu 
to achieve this.

Exit the program - so it is no longer running.

Using Windows Exmplorer, open the directory where you 
extracted the contents of the ZIP file (in 1. above), and 
then, simply delete the directory to where you extracted the
ZIP file.  e.g.  C:\Program Files\Yahtzee\

Simple as that !



Yahtzee Rules :
---------------

Each game of Yahtzee consists of 13 rounds.

In each round, you roll the five dice (and you can also re-roll any or 
all of the dice up to twice more) and then you score the dice in one of the 
13 scoring categories.

For each game, you must score once and only once in each scoring category.
This means that towards the end of the game you may have to settle for 
scoring zero or a low score in some scoring categories. 

The score is determined by the dice that you have rolled and by the 
category that you have scored it in : 

- Ones           : the sum of all dice with a face value of 1
                   e.g.  1,1,2,4,6 would score 2 points if scored in the "Ones" category.
- Twos           : the sum of all dice with a face value of 2
                   e.g.  2,2,2,4,6 would score 6 points if scored in the "Twos" category.
- Threes         : the sum of all dice with a face value of 3
- Fours          : the sum of all dice with a face value of 4
- Fives          : the sum of all dice with a face value of 5
- Sixes          : the sum of all dice with a face value of 6

- 3 of a Kind    : The sum of all dice, provided you have 3 or more of one of the dice.
                   e.g. 1,4,5,5,5 would score 20 points.

- 4 of a Kind    : The sum of all dice, provided you have 4 or more of one of the dice.
                   e.g. 1,1,1,1,5 would score 9 points, and 1,5,5,5,5 would score 21 points.

- Small Straight : 30 points (4 consecutive numbers).  e.g. 1,2,3,4,6 or 1,2,2,3,4.

- Large Straight : 40 points (5 consecutive numbers).  e.g. 1,2,3,4,5 or 2,3,4,5,6. 

- Full House     : 25 points. A Full House is 3 of a Kind AND a Pair.  e.g. 3,3,3,5,5.

- Chance         : The sum of all dice.  e.g. 1,3,3,5,6 would score 18 points.

- Yahtzee (5 of a Kind) : 50 points

You also get a bonus of 35 points, if the total of all the dice in the 
Ones to Sixes scoring categories is greater than or equal to 63 points. 

Prior to computer versions of Yahtzee, physical dice were rolled, people added 
up the dice in their head, and scoring was done on paper.

Computer versions of Yahtzee, such as my program, mean that you can enjoy Yahtzee
without having all of this hassle.

In addition, my program enforces the Yahtzee rules, sorts the dice, maintains 
high scores, and provides many other features and options to improve the game-play
experience.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Support for various versions of Yahtzee - such as 
  "Multi-Yahtzee".  e.g. 50 for the first Yahtzee, and 
  100 points for each subsequent one.

- Support for multiple human players in a single game.

- Support for human Vs computer play.

- More / better sound effects.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.

                    (65,016 lines of code / comments.)

1.1   3-Feb-2004    Temporarily disable the "Roll Dice" button after each roll  
                    so that the user cannot accidentally twitch and press it twice.
                    If the user has pressed "R" (to Roll the Dice), but no game 
                    is in progress, then let's start a new game.
                    (65,050 lines of code / comments.)

1.2   23-Apr-2004   Make the "Lower Total" edit-boxes read-only.
                    Add more detail into the "Show previous dice - for 
                    this current roll" button's report.
                    Make the "Roll Dice" button selected after each roll - so 
                    that the cursor isn't sitting in a score box and blinking.
                    Show your score's ranking when you return to the main screen.
                    e.g. Game Over - your score was 33 out of 100.
                    Stop the ability to select dice for rolling after you have 
                    chosen a scoring category.  i.e. between choosing the scoring 
                    category and proceeding with your next roll.
                    (65,144 lines of code / comments.)

1.3   29-Apr-2004   If you get a high score, then make the appropriate row of 
                    the high score table visible.
                    i.e. scroll the display down / up to reveal the row of the 
                    high score table where you just entered your score.
                    (65,621 lines of code / comments.)

1.3f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.


If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is possibly an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my WEB page - see below.
