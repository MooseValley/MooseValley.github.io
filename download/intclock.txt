Introduction :
--------------

International Clock for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

International Clock enables you to see :
- The current date / time for the location you are in now.
- The current date / time for up to 10 other locations 
  (anywhere in the world) you specify, according to the 
  time differences you specify.
- A time comparison table with each hour in the day in one location
  with the time in any of the other 10 locations.
  No longer will you need to say : "Oh, it's 4:30 PM here and they are
  8.5 hours behind, Um..., Erm..., what the hell is the time there ??"
  As International Clock will work it all out for you !

I wrote this utility to enable me to keep track of time in Australia
and in the UK, because I was speaking a lot on the phone
to someone in the UK, and I wanted to make sure that the time I
called them was convenient, and not anti-social.

In the age of global communications and the Internet, many people 
might find International Clock an invaluable program.  I hope
so anyway !


The Future :
------------
In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- A much better / easier way to select the locations you want to 
  monitor.  e.g. use Display a list of the Regional Location Settings 
  that Windows knows about and allow the user to select multiple of 
  these to monitor.

- A better way to specify where you currently are.  At the moment, 
  if you move to another time zone, you have to re-specify the time 
  difference setting for *every* location you monitor.  This SUCKS !!!

- The ability for the user to choose back / foreground font colours.

- The ability to change the fonts in labels / time display.

- The ability for the user to dynamically change the space between 
  the label and time columns.

- Possibly implement short and long descriptions / names for each 
  location to enable real window size shrinkage.

- 12 / 24 hour clocks.

- The ability to turn off seconds.

- The ability to put the clock onto the system tray.

- The ability to shrink down the date display - put a (-1) for 
  1 day behind or (+1) for 1 day ahead - this way you can see 
  the time at each location and know what the date is as well 
  without having to see "Tuesday July 8" spelt out on each line.

- Let user to choose "date" format next version. e.g. If they 
  don't want to display the "year".

- Anything else ?

I have wanted to make many of these changes for years (especially 
the first two on the list), but have never got around to it,
mainly because, saldy, this program has received ZERO support, 
donations, and registrations, so there has been no incentive 
for me to make these changes.

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.

                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.

2.6   01-Feb-2001   Store the INI settings file in the program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough

                    to fix NTDLL.DLL errors on closedown which 
                    occured on some Windows NT configurations.
                    (7,360 lines of code / comments.)

2.7  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (7,977 lines of code / comments.)

2.7b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (33,809 lines of code / comments.)
