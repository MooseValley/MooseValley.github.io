Introduction :
--------------

File Synchronizer for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, ME, XP, Vista, 7, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

File Synchronizer allows you to sychronise some or all
of the files in 2 directories, and if you like, all of
their sub-directories.

File Synchronizer is (hopefully) extremely useful for people 
who (like me) have their data spread over multiple PCs - such as Work 
and Home PCs, along with work on floppies, removable harddrives,
ZIP / JAZZ / SyQyest / Orb drives, rewritable CDs, or other media.

This program enables you to easily and quickly make sure 
you have the latest versions of files on all machines / media,
and that your master directory contains the latest versions 
of all files.

File Synchronizer is a complex program behind the scenes,
(and some ambiguous "help" in Delphi's on-line help cost me 
dozens of hours of wasted work), and has been in development 
and testing for over 6 months (since June 2001).

I use this program at least several times each day, and find it
incredibly useful, and hope that you do to.

Using the new "Multi" button, you can select multiple directory pairs
(that you have already setup and saved to file) at once.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.


Using this Program :
--------------------

Use the directory selection buttons to select two directories.

You can also Drag and Drop of directories from Windows Explorer.

This Drag and Drop works in 2 ways :

 1. You can drag and drop a single directory onto the 
    first or second directory editboxes.

 2. You can also drag two directories onto the program's 
    main window (not onto one of the edit boxes) and they 
    will be placed into each edit box.  (If you drag more 
    than 2 directories or drag and drop files instead, 
    then they will be ignored). 

This hopefully provides maximum flexibility to users, 
with a minimum of fuss.

Use the Settings tab to change the functionality of the program 
to suit your needs - normally you will synchronize all files
in a directory and its sub-directories (and this is the default
setting), but you can select other options.

Then, press the "Build File Lists" button and the program will build 
lists of all files in the selected directories, and also check 
file dates and times to determine the latest versions of files, 
find common files, and find unique files.

Then, when this has finished, the program will tell you how many
files need updating and how many files are unique, and you can also
(if you desire) select the various file lists :
- Files in First Directory
- Files in Second Directory
- Common Files
- Files Only in the First Directory
- Files Only in the Second Directory
- Files in both but older in the First Directory
- Files in both but older in the Second Directory

to see the various file lists.

Then you can press the "Synchronise Files" button, and files 
will be copied according to your selections on the Settings tab.

The whole process can take milliseconds or less for dozens of 
files, or can take 10's of seconds if there are 1,000's of
files or if you are running on a low end PC.

Finally, you can save the pairs of selected directories and load 
them back in again at any time in the future using the :
- Load Directory Selections menu option
- Save Directory Selections 
menu options under the File menu, or, you can press the Load
and Save buttons on the right hand side of the directory selection
boxes.

If you want to copy any of the lists of files to the Windows Clipboard
so that you can paste them somewhere else, press the "Copy to Clipboard"
button when the list of files you want is being displayed.

If you want this program's window to "Stay on Top" of all other 
programs, then select the "Stay On Top" option under the File menu.

If you want to restore the program back to the state it was in when 
you first installed it, then select the "Restore Factory Defaults"
option under the File menu.

If you want this program to run automatically at Windows Startup
then select the "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" option under the 
File menu.

Apart from that, you can :
- Enter or View your Registration Codes,
- View this Readme Help file,
- View the Registration Form,
- View my Shareware Catalog,
- Or see some information about this program,
via menu options under the Help menu.

Hopefully the program is as easy and straight forward to use 
as possible.


Why I Wrote This Program :
--------------------------

I use PCs all day at work, and most of my time at home as well.
And, my work enables me to telework and to do most of my work at home.
Which is exactly what I do, because my work office is full of 
distractions.

Because of the volume of data and work involved, I use 
Removable Harddrives (in removable harddrive racks) to transfer
my work between my Home Office and Work Office PCs.  Occasionally,
I also use floppy disks as well - but this is rare.  In addition, 
I keep backups of all of my data (work and home data) on all of my 
PCs - at work and home.

The "My Documents" directory (and its sub-directories) on my machines
have well over 18,000 files - and these are just my new / changed 
files since 1996 !!  (i.e. 6 years of work).

Keeping track of changes to these documents, and making sure I am 
using the latest version of each file has become a critical and 
difficult to manage task.

Microsoft Windows 95, etc include "My Briefcase" which apparently 
helps you manage your files - but I have never been game to use it.  
There is no on-line help for this program (that I have found, anyway), 
and I will not risk my valuable data on a program that cannot tell 
me how it works or what it does.

So, as I tend to do, I decided to write my own File Synchronizer 
program to help me manage my 1,000's of files.  This was a far bigger 
task that I originally believed, and ended up taking me more than 6 
months of "on again off again" part-time development and testing.

This program includes the options and settings which I find useful, 
and hope you do to.

(See the Settings Tab on the main screen for further information).


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Anything else ?  Let me know !

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.

50,000+ Lines of Code ??? Your f^%@ing kidding me !!!
------------------------------------------------------

In the "Amendment History" below, I quote the number of lines of code / comments
for *every* one of my projects.  This was a very interesting experiment that 
I began conducting in August-1996 when I uploaded my first freeware / shareware
program and started Moose's Software Valley.

Before this, no other software author I had ever seen had quoted the number of 
lines of code in their projects.  It was kept hidden.  A secret.

Programmers (in the "old days" anyway) hated to reveal this information
because they lived in eternal fear that another programmer would come along 
and do the same thing in half the amount of code.

Yes, there's a eternal "pissing contest" amongst programmers: the less lines 
of code they write to do something, the bigger their penis, or so many think.
Really, it's quite pathetic.  

When, I began quoting the number of lines of code for my projects (in the 
"Amendment History" below), I was the only programmer I could find who did 
this, and I did it for 3 reasons:
* to be the first to do it (or the first as far as I could tell), 
* to be open and honest about my projects, 
* to see what comments I would get back about this.  e.g. would anyone try 
  and challenge me in some pathetic "pissing contest" ?

I was amazed at some of the hysterical and abusive feedback I have received
about this over the years.  Before we get to this, let me explain how I 
develop software.

I do it the right way.

All of my applications are built on my own custom application framework that 
includes libraries (include files, reusable containers, etc) for form scaling, 
string processing, listbox processing, graphics handling, and many dozens of 
other categories of methods.  

Whenever I write code that might be useful somewhere else (in another project), 
I code it as a reusable method and add it to the appropriate library file.  

This is an excellent thing to do because I *never* have to reinvent any wheels, 
and I can use and build on these methods in the future to *enormously* speed up 
my development time.

If I want to use one of my library methods in a project, I include the 
appropriate library file and this is compiled along with my project, and all of 
the lines of code in this library are added to the compiled lines of code value 
that Delphi displays after a compile.

In a typical project, I include dozens of library files, and all of the lines 
of code these library files contain is added onto the compiled lines of code 
value that Delphi displays after a compile, even though I might only use / need 
1 or 2 methods out of the 100's of methods in each library file.

The main source file for each of my projects is probably only 300 to 1,000 lines 
of code (including white space and comment lines).  The rest of the lines of 
code that I quote in the "Amendment History" below are for the compilation 
of the library files I have included in the project.

In addition, code is far easier to understand, debug, trace through, and test 
when it is written nicely.  Trying to shrink the lines of code down by embedding 
many statements per line, using arcade code constructs, or doing things the hard 
way (to save a few lines of code), results in a mess of code that is
very difficult to understand, debug, trace through, or test.  The people who 
go for code size over understandability also tend to leave out comments (that 
.

I'll write the longer, nicer, and easy to understand, debug, trace through, and 
test code every time (unless there is a *very* good reason to do otherwise, 
e.g. where the utmost performance is required, such as for an OS, game, an 
encryption method, etc).  I also add comments to my code (where appropriate) 
to explain exactly what I'm doing and why.

Just thought I would explain this because some people have become hysterical 
and even abusive about the "lines of code" numbers I've quoted over the years, 
saying stuff like:
	
	"50,000 lines of code ???  You've got to be F*@KING kidding me !!!
	I could do this in 2,000 lines !!!!  What the F*@K are you doing ????  
	Are you writing F*@KING a novel or something ??????".

Yes, since I started Moose's Software Valley in August-1996, I've had 
more than a few emails just like this.

Writing software is all about making your code as easy to read and understand 
as possible, and sticking useful / common code inside libraries (or some 
other reusable container) to save you reinventing the wheel all the time.

Perhaps one day people, who make comments like the above, might understand this.

Then again, probably not ....


Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0   11-Mar-2002   First Public Release.
                    (21,685 lines of code / comments.)

1.1   18-Mar-2002   Enable Drag and Drop of directories from Windows Explorer.
                    This Drag and Drop works in 2 ways :
                    1. You can drag and drop a single directory onto the 
                       first or second directory editboxes.
                    2. You can also drag two directories onto the program's 
                       main window (not onto one of the edit boxes) and they 
                       will be placed into each edit box.  (If you drag more 
                       than 2 directories or drag and drop files instead, 
                       then they will be ignored). 
                    This hopefully provides maximum flexibility to users, 
                    with a minimum of fuss.
                    Use a better icon for the "Load Directories" button.
                    (21,964 lines of code / comments.)

1.1b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (36,702 lines of code / comments.)

1.2   26-Nov-2002   Display a Step x of y and file a of b figures while synchronizing 
                    files - to give you an idea of the progress so far.
                    Add in functionality to allow you to process files modified on 
                    or after a certain date / time.  This functionality speeds up 
                    the processing of recently changed files enormously - 
                    especially when you have directory trees (like c:\My Documents) 
                    with 20,000+ files !!  (Yes, like me ... ;)
                    Add File Menu options to enable the user to create or delete 
                    shortcuts to this program on the Desktop, StartMenu, SendTo menu, 
                    etc - you can do this *ANY* time - not just when the program is 
                    being installed.  (All Windows programs should provide this 
                    functionality).
                    (49,339 lines of code / comments.)

1.3f  7-Dec-2010    Add in "Only Save First Setting" safety checkboxes to "Synchronize 
                    Directory Options", "Synchronize Files Options", and "File Last 
                    Modified Date / Time" settings groups - because it is easy to select 
                    one of the other "dangerous" settings and exit and then forget to 
                    reset the settings next time you run the program, thereby 
                    not synchronising all files in all sub dirs. These new safety 
                    settings are checked by default. If you want to make sure the 
                    settings saved by the program are the safest possible, then 
                    leave these new checkboxes checked.
                    Remove "Multiple Directories" tab. This was something I started 
                    building and then abandonded when all of my software became freeware.
                    Fix "run out of disk space" issue - remove the half copied file.
                    If one fo the DIRs does not exist, then offer to create it.
                    Display the total size (in MB) of files copied after the file 
                    synchronisation.
                    Display elapsed time (in secs) for file synchronisation.
                    Display Average Copy Speed (in MB/sec) for file synchronisation.
                    Display "Step 1 of ..." for list building process.
                    Fix the spelling of "synchrized" in this error message "File's 
                    date / time could NOT be synchrized ...".
                    Add a "Compare Common Files" button to compare all common files 
                    and generate a brief report listing the common files that weren't 
                    identical.
                    Add a "Remove Selected" button to Remove selected items from list. 
                    Note: No files will be deleted from your machine, they are just 
                    removed from this list.
                    Add a "Delete Selected Files" button to delete the selected files 
                    permanently. Warning: All selected files will be deleted from your 
                    machine !!
                    Add a comma to some messages in the Title Bar. For example, change 
                    this: "Dir and All Sub Dirs, First Dir is the Master files of any age." 
                    to this: "Dir and All Sub Dirs, First Dir is the Master, Files of Any Age." 
 
1.4f  1-Feb-2011    Add extra functionality to the "Compare Common Files" function.
                    Now, if any files mismatch, you are shown a list, and then you can
                    select which directory contains the correct files and then copy and
                    recompare these by clicking the "Re-Copy and Re-Compare Files" button, 
                    to copy, re-compare, and then display the results of this process 
                    (to make sure all files now match).  This makes it dead easy to make 
                    sure all files is each directory are 100% the same.
                    Add buttons / functionality to open either of the directories in Windows 
                    Explorer - this can be useful if you want to take a closer look or 
                    perform any actions on the files / directories.
                    If any settings change that require a re-build of file lists before a 
                    file sync, then disable File Sync button until user re-builds file lists.
                    (59,848 lines of code / comments.)

2.01f               Add a "Multi" button so that you can process many or all directory pairs
                    at once.  (Something I need to do several times every day).
                    At this stage, the "Multi" button is for synchronising files, not for 
                    comparing files.


2.1f  19-Sep-2011   Save / restore the checked / unchecked status of the "Multi" button's list.
                    Add a new section to this readme text file (see above): 
                    * "50,000+ Lines of Code ??? Your f^%@ing kidding me !!!".
                    
                    WOW, it's more than 9 years after the first public release of this program, 
                    and I still use this program at least several times every day, and find it
                    incredibly useful.  I move files in many directories between home and work PCs
                    every day on several USB thumb drives (for extra backups), and File Synchronizer 
                    allows me to keep all of these files perfectly synchronised.
                    Out of all of the software on my PCs, this is the program I use most !!  :)
                    (70,921 lines of code / comments.)


If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is possibly an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my WEB page - see below.
