Introduction :
--------------

Disk Space Logger for Windows 95 / 98 / ME / NT / 2000, 
Vista, 7, 8, 32 or 64 bit, etc.

Disk Space Logger enables you to quickly and easily keep track of 
the amount of free disk space on a particular drive in or attached 
to your machine.

Settings allow you to specify a wide range of logging options,
including:
* The drive to log.  e.g. C:, D:, etc.
* The number of seconds between log events.  e.g. 10 seconds means 
  that the free disk space is checked and logged every 10 seconds.
* The order in which data is added to the list (at the top 
  or at the bottom)
* When to log the first disk space item - when the start button is 
  pressed or when the timer reaches zero,
* The Units of Measure: KB, MB, GB, etc all the way up to YB.
  Given that current harddrives drives are measured in TB, with the 
  largest being around 4 TB for desktop use, it will be probably
  be decades or centuries before the YB measure is needed.
* The Conversion factor. i.e. whether a KB is 1024 or 1000 bytes.
* The number of decimal places to display.

All but one of these settings can be changed while the program is 
logging the free disk space.  This could be useful if you need to 
drop down to MB or even KB to really keep an eye on how much disk 
space is available.

The only setting you cannot change while the programm is logging free 
disk space is the Drive setting.  If you could change the drive on the 
fly, then the Average, Min, Max, from the prior drive would be either 
be lost or corrupted and meaningless, and the log would become 
meaningless - which drive is this for ?

So, if you want to change Drives, click "Stop", and then click 
"Reset" to reset everything, change the drive, and then click "Start" 
to start the logging again.

This seems the only safe way to handle this, but if anyone has any 
suggestions, email me and let me know.  :)

Changing the settings does NOT effect existing / prior log entries 
(they are history, and they cannot be changed), but only future log 
entries.  This provides maximum flexibility.  e.g. you can do some 
logging in GB and then in a tricky part where you want to see 
greater detail, you can log in MB or KB, or increase the number of 
decimal points for a while, and so on.  Doing so will only effect 
future log entries.

The abbreviations used for KB, MB, etc are all according to the
IEC standard (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrabyte).
I adopted the IEC standard, because it covers everything.
Others, like JEDEC, do not.  For example, JEDEC does not go 
beyond TB (or, at least it doesn't according to Wikipedia).

This means that if you have selected 1000 as the Conversion Factor
then the disk size / space abbreviations are: kB, MB, GB, TB, etc.  
i.e. 1 kB = 1000 bytes, and 1 MB = 1000 kB, and so on.
(Yes, lowercase "k" is correct in "kB" according to the standard).

But, if you select 1024 as the Conversion Factor, then the 
disk size / space abbreviations are: KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, 
etc.  i.e. 1 KiB = 1024 bytes, and 1 MiB = 1024 KiB, and so on.

I cannot tell you how much this rankles me !!!

I am definitely a traditional guy when it comes disk size / space 
units of measure.  i.e. KB, MB, etc and I believe that 
a KB should always be 1024 bytes.  Not a KiB ! 
If anything, the KiB should be when you divide by 1000 !

But the standard does not agree with me.  And, I have 
abided by what the standard says.

If you don't agree with this, blame the likes of the IEC, 
not me !  :P

The "Start" and "Stop" buttons start and stop the logging.
A blue progress bar displays an indication of the number of 
seconds left before the next disk space reading is logged.

The "Reset" button resets the log, and the Min, Max, Average 
values displayed.

Buttons are provided next to the Min, Max, Average 
values to enable you to copy and paste the values to 
Windows Clipboard.

"Copy" and "Save" buttons are provided next to the log to
allow you to copy it to Windows Clipboard and save it to file 
respectively.

And that's about it.  Everything should hopefully be pretty 
self explanatory.  Any questions or problems, let me know.  :)

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.


Why is this useful ?  /  Why do this ?
--------------------------------------

I wrote this program on 23-Sep-2013 to keep track of the free 
disk space used by a *very* badly behaved installer, which said 
it needed 3,288 MB, when in reality it needed more than 11 GB.
I wanted to log the disk space used so that I could provide 
information to the developers of the product so that they could 
fix their installer.

This program would be useful for anyone maintaining installers.
And for anyone who wants to keep a log of disk space usage 
on their computer while it is performing various tasks, 
for whatever reasons they may have.

If you find any good uses for this program, please email me and 
let me know.  :)
