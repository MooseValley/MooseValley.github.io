Introduction :
--------------

Copy_File_Mod_DateTime is a console application for DOS which runs perfectly in
a DOS shell, command line, DOS batch script, etc under Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, 
XP, Vista, 7, 8, etc.

Usage: execute the program with 2 command line parameters to specify the file 
extensions that you want to process in the current directory:

	Copy_File_Mod_DateTime extn1 extn2

Example: 
	`Copy_File_Mod_DateTime txt doc
          
This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

This program copies the file modified date/time from all files in the current 
directory which have a particular extension to the same file with another 
extension.

For example, if a directory contains a bunch of video files, such as:
- abc.avi
- abc.mp4
- My Home movie.AVI
- My Home movie.mP4

and you want to copy the file modified date/time from all AVI 
files to their matching MP4 counterparts, then you would use a command like 
this (in the directory where these files exist): 

	Copy_File_Mod_DateTime avi mp4

After this command has run you, the file modified date/time for "abc.mp4" 
would be the same as "abc.avi", and the file modified date/time for 
"My Home movie.mP4" would be the same as "My Home movie.AVI", and so 
on for all matching pairs of AVIs and MP4 files in the current directory.

Why is this useful ?  Why do this ? I do lots of video and picture conversions,
and I wanted the converted files to have the same modified date/time as the 
original file.  I did a bunch of internet searches, but these found no program 
or utility that did this.  So, I wrote this program to do what I needed.

The program works for files with any extensions - so it works for images 
(bmp, jpg, png, etc), documents, spreadsheets, and all other file types.

This program is completely case insensitive, so it does not matter whether 
files have uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case names or extensions - they 
will all be handled.  e.g. "abc.AVI" is handled the same as "AbC.avI".

Also, full stops and asterisks are ignored in the parameters, so these commands 
are all handled in exactly the same way:

	Copy_File_Mod_DateTime txt doc
	Copy_File_Mod_DateTime *.txt *.doc
	Copy_File_Mod_DateTime .txt .doc

See "Sample Execution / Demo" below for further details.

Who knows, maybe someone else out there will find this program useful ?


Sample Execution / Demo:
-------------------------

In the sample execution / demo below, I type in these commands:

	dir
	Copy_File_Mod_DateTime.exe bmp jpg
	dir

and show the results of these commands.  

With these commands, I list the files in the current directory, then execute 
Copy_File_Mod_DateTime to copy the file modified date/time from BMP to JPG files, 
and then I list the files in the current directory again to show the results of 
the processing.

The Future :
-------------

This is an early release of the program, and several interesting
things could be done in the future :

- Add a "/s" parameter switch to process all files in all sub-directories as 
  well as the current directory.  Would this be useful ?

- Add a "/q" parameter switch to stop messages being produced during execution.
  Would this be useful ?

- Any other changes.  Can you suggest any ?

Email me if you have any suggestions.
