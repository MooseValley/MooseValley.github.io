Introduction :

ZIP Password Cracker Pro for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 
2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

ZIP Password Cracker Pro enables you to generate 
passwords and apply these to password protected
ZIP files.

This can be an incredibly useful thing to do when you
have backed up data to a ZIP file and mistyped or 
forgotten the password.  

This program saves Restart information as it tests 
passwords (every 10,000 passwords, or whenever the 
program is closed), so that if your computer crashes, 
or there is a power failure, or if you switch your 
computer off, then this program can continue where 
it left off next time you run it when you press 
the "Continue ZIP Testing" button.

This program currently supports ZIP files only - it will 
not work with RAR, ACE, or other compressed archive types.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Why I wrote this program ?  What can it do ?
--------------------------------------------

In early 1998, I backed up loads of data to a ZIP file,
but when I went to restore some files from the backup
months later (in August 1998), I realised that I had 
mistyped my password and that my data was locked up 
tighter than a duck's arsehole.  ;)

I needed help to recover my password so that I could 
retrieve the files I needed.  So, as I usually do, I 
sat down and wrote this program.

I use very long passwords for all of my ZIP files - 15
characters or longer - and I use numbers, letters, and
other characters.

Now, the problem was that taking these characters and 
generating random passwords of this size would generate 
trillions of trillions of passwords.  Pretty soon I 
realised that it was going to take 1,000's of centuries 
on my poor old Pentium 100 to crack my ZIP file's 
password by Brute Force methods.

So, I realised that for my particular ZIP file, 
I needed something a lot better and a lot more focused 
than Brute Force methods.

So, then I added the "Password is Partly Known"
tab so that I could enter the characters I thought 
I had used in my ZIP file's password.  This
functionality then generated passwords by simulating
the hitting of keys around the keys used to type the
password I thought I had typed.

This resulted in far fewer passwords being generated 
and tested / trialed.

Then, I left my program running over night trying these
"Partly Known Passwords" against my password protected
ZIP file, and by morning it had worked out my mistyped 
password, and I could retrieve data from my ZIP file.

So, ZIP Password Cracker Pro will not be useful to
anyone wanting to crack any reasonably protected 
ZIP files.  e.g. where passwords are 10 characters
or more long.

But, this means that ZIP Password Cracker Pro
is still ideal for use in the following ways :

- use the "Password is Partly Known" functionality to
  crack short or long passwords when you have a reasonably 
  good idea what the password is.

or

- use "Brute Force Password Cracking" functionality 
  to crack shorter passwords when you have no idea what 
  the password is.


Benchmark Results :
--------------------

Below are some benchmark results :

- the number of passwords generated per second, and,

- the number of passwords tested against a small password 
  protected test ZIP file per second

for various computers that I have run Zip Cracker Pro on.

As time goes by, and I buy more powerful computers, or if people 
email me and let me know the benchmark results for their computers,
then I'll add more details to the above benchmark results.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\zip_crack\ - and run the executable 
file : Zip_Cracker.EXE.

You then need to decide which method you want to use :

 - Brute Force Password Cracking
   This is most useful when you know nothing about the 
   password for the ZIP file.  Simply select uppercase
   letters, lowercase letters, numbers, etc and specify the
   length of passwords to generate, and then press the
   "Generate Passwords" passwords button.

 - Password is Partly Known
   This is most useful when you do know something about the 
   password for the ZIP file.  Simply type in the letters / 
   numbers / etc you think are in the required password,
   select the required options (Double hit each key, etc)
   and then press the "Generate Passwords" passwords button.

When the passwords are generated (according to your settings),
then the list of passwords will be displayed, and you will
be able to specify the ZIP file to test, and then test each 
password against the ZIP file.

In addition, you will see the estimated time to test 
all passwords in the list, which is based on your PC's
performance during previous ZIP file tests.

This program saves Restart information as it tests 
passwords, so that if your computer crashes, or there 
is a power failure, or you switch your computer off,
then this program will continue where it left off
next time you run it when you press the "Continue ZIP 
Testing" button.

This means that if your computer has been running for 
3 days testing 1,000's of passwords, and it crashes
or the power fails, then you do not need to start at 
the very beginning again.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete ZIP Password Cracker Pro 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever you installed
    it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

I've got tons of ideas for this program.

But, of course, I will be very cautious in what features 
I add because I don't want to do anything to help any 
hackers / crackers out there gain access to any 
unauthorised data.  e.g. data inside password 
protected ZIP files that they should not be accessing.

Indeed, some ZIP files on my WEB site are protected - such 
as Talking Clock's speech packs - and only registered 
users get the passwords to access these files.  

So, I am very careful not to provide any functionality 
to allow internet based hackers / crackers to rip off 
any more of my work.  (These bastards do enough of this 
already !!)

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Better password generation methods.
  e.g. when you know the first part of the password is 
  "fred" and/or the last part of the password is "15".

- Support for other compressed archive types.  
  e.g. RAR, ACE, etc.  At the moment, this program only 
  supports ZIP files.

- Support for using pre-built lists of words, with the 
  ability to build these into extended lists - with 
  numeric prefixes, etc appended to each word in the list.

- Support for bigger password lists.  See "Known Issues / Known 
  Limitations" below and "Q. Can you add support for millions of 
  billions of trillions of passwords (and more) ?" in the FAQ below.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have supported my efforts, and how dangerous I think 
new features are, etc.


Known Issues / Known Limitations:
---------------------------------

The TMemo component I am using has a 2 GB limit.

So, for example, if you are generating 10 character passwords, 
then each password requires 10 characters plus 2 characters for 
the Carriage Return / Line Feed (CR/LF) (on Windows PCs) at 
the end of each line, which is 12 characters per password. And, 
the storage required is 2 bytes per character (16 bit ASCII), 
which makes a total of: (10 + 2) x 2 bytes = 24 bytes per password.

So, the 2 GB TMemo component can hold about 83 million 10 character 
passwords.

83 million might sound like a lot, but it is a very small number 
when it comes to  generating random passwords.

For example, the number of combinations of 10 character passwords 
containing just the digits 0-9 is 10,000,000,000, or about 120 
times what a TMemo component can hold.

Clearly, you wont be using ZIP Cracker to crack long / complex 
passwords, and this suits me just fine.  I don't want this program 
to be used by people trying to break into ZIP files they should 
not be trying to break into.

Also see "Q. Can you add support for millions of billions of trillions 
of passwords (and more) ?" in the FAQ below.


Frequently Asked Questions / FAQ / F.A.Q.:
------------------------------------------

Q. I cannot make this program generate passwords very fast. It 
starts out very quickly running close to what your benchmark
tests are. However, after it gets to about 100,000 passwords being
generated, it seems to do only about 100 passwords a second if that.

A. This was an issue with the TMemoEx component I was using, and was 
fixed in v1.3f (released on 23-Oct-2013).


Q. Zip Cracker should be able to generate passwords much faster on 
my multi-cored, super ninja PC, what's wrong with it ?

A. Yes, I could speed up password generation, but I certainly don't 
want it easier for thieves to break into other people's ZIP files.  

NOTE: I am certainly not implying you are a thief or that you might 
be doing something wrong, but I have to consider that there are people 
out there who might be treading the dark paths.

Also see "When are we going to see [put your new feature here] ?" below.


Q. I don't believe ZIP Cracker is running with both cores ?

Sorry, this program was written *long* before dual core CPUs were 
available for home computers.  Zip Cracker is single core, single 
threaded only.

Yes, I could make the program highly multi-threaded, but I 
certainly don't want to make it easier for thieves to break into 
other people's ZIP files.  

NOTE: I am certainly not implying you are a thief or that you might 
be doing something wrong, but I have to consider that there are people 
out there who might be treading the dark paths.

(See "When are we going to see [put your new feature here] ?" below).


Q. I have created a ZIP file with 7Zip, but ZIP Cracker says the 
encryption or format isn't standard ?

A. Make sure the encryption method is "ZypCrypto".  AES-256 is not 
supported by the unZdll.dll I'm using.


Q. When are we going to see [put your new feature here] ?

A.  I am very reluctant to speed up password generation, 
add in multi threaded processing, or support super large 
password sets (Known Issues / Known Limitations), see etc.  

Frankly, ZIP Cracker is frightening software.  It could cause 
enormous damage in the wrong hands.  The aim of the program is 
*NOT* to allow thieves to try and crack passwords for ZIP files 
they don't own.  The aim is to allow people who have some idea of 
the password (they know at least a few letters, etc) - because 
they own the ZIP file and the data it contains.

I certainly don't want to make it easier for thieves to 
break into other people's ZIP files.

NOTE: I am certainly not implying you are a thief or that you might 
be doing something wrong, but I have to consider that there are people 
out there who might be treading the dark paths.

Another factor for me is making good use of my time.  I'm not 
going to do lots of work for free (especially when this work 
could help thieves).  


Q. Can you add support for millions of billions of trillions 
of passwords (and more) ?

A.  No.  I certainly don't want to make it easier for thieves to 
break into other people's ZIP files.

NOTE: I am certainly not implying you are a thief or that you might 
be doing something wrong, but I have to consider that there are people 
out there who might be treading the dark paths.

Also see "Known Issues / Known Limitations" above.


Q. Please add support for newer or non-standard ZIP file format(s) or
newer or non-standard encryption method(s) ?

A.  I will continue to explore other / more up-to-date ZIP components, 
but no guarantees.  (Exploring each one is many hours of work 
and many seem to have issues and few seem to have help files 
associated with them).  In short, it is a very tedious process that 
usually involves lots of "shooting fish in barrels".  
i.e. guess work and trial and error.


Q. Why don't you add message boards / forums to your web site where 
questions are answered?

A. I used to have message boards on my web site, but spammers kept 
filling them with viagra, fake watches, and other crap.  Thank 
the spammers of the internet for their removal.  :)


Q. I have found a ZIP Component that works well with Delphi v5, 
supports a wide variety of ZIP formats,  and has 
documentation (a help file) and it is easy to install ?

A. Yes, please email me the details and I will check it out.  :)


Q. I think I have found a bug in Zip Cracker or another of 
Moose's Software Valley programs ?

A. Please check the text file that comes with the program.  If the 
issue isn't mentioned there (for example, as a "known issue") then 
please email me details and I will check it out.


Q. Web site [insert web site name here] has a download for your software 
but it is an old version, can you update it or get them to update it ?

A. No, life's too short.  Many web sites copy my files and add them as 
downloads on their web site, but they do this without my knowledge and 
without my permission.  So, I don't know who they are, I don't know how 
to contact them, and I don't know how to get them to update their old 
files, and I don't have time to chase around many 1,000's of web sites 
and find out this information and ask them to update their files.

For the record, I don't mind web sites copying my files and adding them 
to their download section, as long as:
1. My files remain intact (e.g. they don't go changing any of my files 
   inside the ZIP files), 
2. And they periodically check for updates (a couple of times per year 
   should be sufficient).  If they want me to send them an email 
   when any of my programs are updated, I'd be happy to do this.  It 
   would take me seconds to setup a spreadsheet with a list of email 
   addresses for each of my software titles.


Q. I do very much love your program.

A. Hey, thank you very much for your kind words / feedback. :)  :)

1.0  22-May-2002    First Public Release.
                    (29,649 lines of code / comments.)

1.1  12-Nov-2002    Check file has an extension of 'ZIP' before proceeding 
                    with the testing.
                    Verify the ZIP file is a valid ZIP file before doing any 
                    subsequent processing or testing.
                    Enormously speed up password generation and password 
                    testing for Registered Users of this program by :
                      1. Updating the stats every 100 passwords - not every 
                         password as this slow things down significantly.
                      2. Dynamically loading DLLs prior to processing.
                      3. Various other techniques and tricks.
                    Registered users can test passwords 5-20 times or
                    so faster than Un-Registered users (depends on PC).
                    Change the font to a scalable font for all items.
                    (Fix the auto size-text truncation).
                    Use colours to reflect the status of edit boxes : 
                    grey = read only, white = user input, etc.
                    Add in support for the dragging and dropping of ZIP 
                    file(s) from Windows Explorer.
                    Add "Benchmark Results" section to this text file.
                    Add buttons to enable the user to reset password list, 
                    and copy list to Windows clipboard, and paste password 
                    list from Windows clipboard.  (Registered Users only).
                    Add in the ability to continue password checking against
                    a ZIP file, if a correct password has already been found
                    but this password does not work on all files inside the 
                    ZIP file.  (Yes, some ZIP files are encrypted with 
                    multiple passwords).
                    Add in support for notification, testing, and advice
                    regarding unencrypted files (i.e. those with blank 
                    passwords).
                    Add in a pre-ZIP testing advice screen (with a 
                    "Do Not Show This Again" option).
                    Use a better initial default window size.
                    Various other use-ability enhancements.
                    (37,772 lines of code / comments.)

1.1b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (43,009 lines of code / comments.)

1.2    4-Dec-2002   Add File Menu options to enable the user to create or delete 
                    shortcuts to this program on the Desktop, StartMenu, SendTo, etc
                    and you can do this *ANY* time - not just when the program is 
                    being installed.  (All Windows programs should provide this 
                    functionality).
                    You can now right-mouse click on a ZIP file and send it to
                    this program directly - provided there is a shortcut
                    to the program in the SendTo menu.  (See above).
                    Insert the characters around each key for some keys that
                    were missing these for the "Password is Partly Known"
                    password generations.  e.g. The keys around the "."  
                    key are ",<L;:'"/?".  (Thanks to Robert F for reporting 
                    this to me earlier today).
                    (55,759 lines of code / comments.)

1.2f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.

1.2fb 13-Jan-2011   Update the DLL (UnzDll.dll) included with ZIP Password Cracker Pro.
                    Special thanks to Lost Identity for alerting me to the fact my 
                    program wasn't finding ZIP passwords properly.  It turned out it 
                    wasn't, because the DLL (UnzDll.dll) included with ZIP Password 
                    Cracker Pro was not the required version.
                    The EXE has *not* changed, it is still 1.2f.
                    i.e. 1.2fb is v1.2f with an updated DLL file (not an updated EXE), 
                    so the EXE still reports v1.2f.

 n/a   9-Feb-2012   Add a "Frequently Asked Questions" to this text file above, and 
                    also clarify the 1.2fb update above, following Curtis G's email 
                    earlier today.  I get emails from a few people each year asking 
                    similar questions, so it makes sense to put these in a FAQ.  :)
                    See the "Frequently Asked Questions" above.  :)

1.3f  23-Oct-2013   1. Fix the display of passwords containing the
                    ampersand "&" character.  Prior to this fix,
                    ampersands were being interpreted in the
                    success dialog as "underline the next character".
                    Special thanks to Jerry P. for reporting this.
                    2. Add checking to make sure the selected ZIP file 
                    is a standard ZIP and that it can be decrypted by 
                    the UnzDll.Dll I am using.
                    Special thanks to Jerry P. for reporting this.
                    3. Always check for blank / no password before doing
                    any other password checking.
                    4. If the password is found, display it in a box
                    in the bottom right hand corner and display a
                    "Copy to Clipboard" button next to this to
                    make it easy for the user to obtain the password.
                    5. Display a progress bar while checking passwords
                    to give a nice visual clue of progress.
                    6. Add a "Display ZIP Information" button next to
                    ZIP File name to display basic information about
                    the ZIP file (this is all available information
                    from the DLL I am using), and estimate whether the
                    ZIP format / encryption method is standard and whether
                    the password can be cracked or not.
                    All the DLL seems to return is "ErrorCode 8" if it 
                    doesn't recognise the ZIP format or encryption method 
                    (and this ErrorCode is not mentioned at all in the 
                    Help File for the DLL or the ZIP component).
                    So, all I can do is check for "ErrorCode 8".
                    7. Update to the very latest version of UnzDll.Dll
                    I can find.  It is v173 and dated 15-Jul-2003, obtained
                    from the "compressit.zip" file from Torry's Delphi Pages:
                    http://www.torry.net/pages.php?id=300
                    I will continue to explore other / more up-to-date
                    ZIP components, but no guarantees.  (Exploring each
                    one is many hours of work and many seem to have issues,
                    most seem to be a nightmare to install / get working,
                    and few seem to have help files associated with them).
                    8. Check the version of <b>UnzDll.Dll</b> is the correct / 
                    expected one before trying to crack any passwords.
                    Add extra items to and update the FAQ (above).
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.

1.4f  25-Oct-2013   Another day, another release !!  ;)  LOL !!  ;)
                    1. Change from a 3rd party Memo component, called TMemoEx,
                    back to the standard Delphi TMemo because TMemoEx refuses 
                    to hold more than a few million short passwords.  TMemoEx
                    was refusing to hold more than 3,663,901 four character 
                    passwords. This is very strange, because I have been using 
                    the TMomeEx component for many years and have never encountered 
                    anything like this problem before.  I searched for an updated / 
                    fixed TMemoEx component but could not find one.  This is a 
                    shame because TMemoEx was a lot faster than TMemo.
                    Special thanks to Jerry P. for reporting this issue.
                    2. Display "Loading - Please wait ..." and "Pasting - 
                    Please wait ..." messages when loading passwords or 
                    pasting passwords (TMemo components are very slow 
                    when loading / pasting millions of items).
                    3. I also found that TMemo components behave strangely and 
                    data access speeds fluctuate wildly when they hold millions 
                    of items.  To get around this, I removed the check for 
                    duplicates when generating passwords to keep the speed 
                    the same as prior versions of this program.
                    4. For the Brute Force method, calculate and display the 
                    number of passwords to be generated and display a progress 
                    bar while generating passwords to give a nice visual 
                    clue of progress.
                    You will notice that this release has 3,300+ lines of code 
                    less than yesterday's release, and that's because I am no 
                    longer using the TMemoEx component, and can therefore leave 
                    out all of my code / include files that deal with TMemoEx objects.
                    Add "Known Issues / Known Limitations" to the Zip_Cracker.txt file.
                    Update various sections in the Zip_Cracker.txt file.
                    (2,351 lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (63,934 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all primary, library, and include files.)
