Introduction :
--------------

Quiz Master for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Quiz Master is a program that enables you to easily set-up 
quizes - either for fun, or to test or build knowledge of 
particular subject areas, or to help with assessment of 
student / employee achievement.

Quiz Master enables you to specify :
- The Questions to be asked.
- The list of possible answers, along with the correct answer.
- The time allowed to answer each question, so that
  difficulty questions can be allocated more time.
- The score (or weighting) of questions, so that harder 
  questions can be made to be worth more.

Included with the program is a set of 45 Sample Questions,
but many more questions will be made available in the future.
At the moment, I am working on a set of 1,600 questions !!
These will be available to Registered Users only.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP
file to a directory - such as c:\quizmstr - and run
the executable file quizmstr.EXE.

In the registered version of this program, you can 
setup your own Quiz Question and Answers.
(See below for further information).


Question and Answer File Format :
----------------------------------

The following explains the format of the Question and Answer
file.

Comment Lines :

! -  Any lines starting with an exclamation mark (!) are 
     treated as comments and ignored.

Each Question must consist of :

Q::  The Question to be asked.
A::  Answer - with possible answers seperated by '::'
     N.B. The first answer in the list must be the correct one !

Each Question may also have the following optional
settings :

S::  Score or weighting for the question (1 to 100).
     e.g. 1 = Easy, 10 = Hard.
     (If this parameter is not supplied, the default = 1
      but Registered Users can change this on the
      Settings Screen.)
T::  Time limit for the question in seconds.
     0 indicates no time limit.
     (If this parameter is not supplied, the default = 5
      but Registered Users can change this on the
      Settings Screen.)

In addition, "QT::: is used to hold the Quiz Title (only one 
per quiz), for example :

QT::General Knowledge Quiz

Example :

QT::General Knowledge Quiz
Q::What is the capital of France ?
A::Paris::Berlin::London::Prague
S::1
T::0
Q::If 3 Men can move 7 tonnes of gravel in a 8 hours, how long would it take 11 Men to move the same amount of gravel ?
A::3.2 Hours::3.5 Hours::3 Hours::8 Hours
S::5
Q::Which Day Is Named After A Planet ?
A::Saturday::Monday::Wednesday::Friday
T::3
Q::What Is The Larva Of The Fly Called ?
A::Maggot::Grub::Wiggler::Flyet


Quiz Results File Format :
-----------------------

The Quiz Results File is written with one student result 
record on each line of the file, and with the information 
in each record seperated by commas to enable easy importing 
into Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro Prom or just about any other 
Spreadsheet.

The comma seperated fields of each student result record 
consist of :
- Surname,
- First Name,
- Date that the quiz was attempted,
- Start Time,
- End Time,
- Ellapsed Time taken to complete the quiz (in Seconds).
- Overall Result %.

Example :
O'Malley,Moose,22/11/1999,13:58:58,13:59:32,33.5,90%


Limitations / Restrictions of the Shareware version :


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :
- Ability to specify Success Messages depending of quiz score.
  (At the moment, these are fixed within the program).
- Better / Flashier / More Exciting User Interface.
- Encryption of the Question and Answer File.
  (So students cannot peek at or alter the Questions or Answers).
- Encryption of the Results Log File.
  (So students cannot peek at or alter any results).
- Ability to handle massive question lists - consisting
  of 1,000's of questions.
- Ability to have "Quick Fire" rounds where you try and 
  answer as many questions as possible in 60 seconds.
- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.0   22-Nov-1998   First Public Release.
                    (Written especially for J. T. Lawson.)
                    (5,280 lines of code / comments.)
                    
1.1  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.

                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    When the user select the "Settings" option from the 
                    File menu, only display the "Get Extra Functionality 
                    if you Register" dialog if the program isn't registered.
                    Fix the "Edit Q&A" button - it was editing the Log file 
                    prior to the fix.  Add in "Make Surname and First Name 
                    Entry Mandatory Priot to Quiz" setting.
                    Add in a Quiz Results Form, with a list of the questions 
                    answered wrongly, along with the answeres selected.
                    Add in a "QT::" symbol which enables you to set the title
                    of the quiz from inside the quiz questions file.
                    (9,390 lines of code / comments.)

1.2  14-Mar-2002    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.

                    Make the default time to answer a question 20 seconds,
                    but ofcourse, you can override this using the T:: 
                    parameter - see above.
                    (21,756 lines of code / comments.)

1.2b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
