Introduction :
--------------

This ZIP file contains the Apple 2 disk drive sounds that I recorded for 
use with my "Apple 2 Disk Drive Sound Simulator" program (Windows 95 / 98 / 
ME / NT / 2000 / XP, Vista, etc).



About the Disk Drive Sounds:  (from my "Apple 2 Disk Drive Sound Simulator" program's readme).
-----------------------------

As people may know from the Apple 2 Emulation section of my WEB pages :

	At the best of times, the Apple 2 disk drive used to make horrible 
	grunting and scrapping sounds as it loaded programs.  When I used to go 
	to the local Burleigh Heads library and used the Apple 2 there, everyone 
	in the library would stop and stare (and sometimes glare !) at us 
	whenever the Apple 2 was reading floppy disks - the grunts and groans 
	from the drive were *that* loud !! 

	N.B. These terrible sounds were perfectly normal for Apple 2 drives, 
	and they were quite loud as well, even when using brand new floppy 
	disks and brand new floppy drives. 

However, people today didn't believe me about the sounds or how loud they 
really were.

So now, a short MP3 of some Apple 2 disk drive sounds is available from my 
WEB page.

And, in addition, I have written this program to simulate some Apple 2 
disk drive sounds.

All of the Apple 2 disk drive sounds were recorded by me on April 10 and 11, 
2000.  To record the sounds, I used a cheap microphone hooked up to my 
Windows 98 PC, which was running Goldwave a good sound editing program.
I placed the microphone at the entrance to the Apple 2 floppy drive, and
then proceeded to record the loading sounds the drive made for a bunch
of games and programs.  (I own an Apple ][c with both internal and 
external drives).

Finally, in December 2001, I again listened carefully to the sounds I recorded
18 months ago, and edited out some of the more common sound bytes.

Then, I wrote a Delphi program to play them back, and compiled all of the 
sounds into a single resource file, which was later compiled and compressed 
into the Executable program.  That is why there are no WAV files accompanying 
this program - they are all contained inside the EXE file !!  (See my
"Apple 2 Disk Drive Sound Simulator" program).

The "squeak" was a sound that the disk drive makes very occassionally 
when (I think) it is swinging its read head backwards and forwards 
very quickly and the rubber belt slips - not sure about how it happens 
but it does happen.  It is definitely a sound the drive makes - not
the door on the drive.  I rember it happening on all of the Apple ]['s I
used in the early 1980's and it still happens on my Apple ][c - but it is
very occasional.

The "Ghostbusters" digitised speech sound is not a disk drive sound, 
but I thought it would be fun to add this sound in as well to show 
what digitised speech on the Apple ][ sounded like.  Back in the 
early 80's, this speech was state of the art and I remember 
times when people used to crowd around my Apple ][ just to 
hear it say "Ghostbusters" !!

Hope this is OK.

Long Live the Apple ][ !!!
