Blaster v0.1 (July 1985) for DOS.            by Moose O'Malley

FREE Ware !

This is a very old Prototype of a character based game.

Basically, way back in 1985, I was experimenting
with controling objects on screen - all of different
sizes, colour, shape, and moving in different
directions and at different speeds.

Later I wanted to add in the ability for the enemy ships
to attack back, and then polish the game, and
maybe move it over to graphics - but I never got 
that far.

So, this is only a *very* early prototype.

It is FREE Ware, and you can copy, distribute, and 
use it freely as long as this message remains intact.

The program operates in character mode only.  i.e. it is not a graphical
program, so it will work on any monitor : CGA, EGA, VGA, etc, and 
will run on any PC (with an Intel CPU from 8088 to Pentium Pro), 
and with any amount of memory (it only needs a few dozen KB).

It runs on my 8086 640 KB CGA laptop, and it runs (at the same speed) 
on my Pentium 100 / 16 MB / SVGA.

It also runs under Windows 3.1, 95, NT, but as a DOS application.

This program was written in Turbo Pascal v3 / v5 (DOS).
