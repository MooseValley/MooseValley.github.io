Introduction :
--------------

Internet Download Buddy is designed to help you easily 
download groups of files from the internet.

First off, let's just get it clear what this program 
DOES NOT DO :
- It does NOT resume broken downloads,
- It does NOT verify downloaded files, and, 
- It will NOT help you download entire WEB sites.

But, with that said, it does help you do a lot.

If you have ever encountered the following :

 1. Somebody has scanned a document or a magazine or something
    and put all of the pictures on the internet, but you have
    to click on the thumbnail images or links to get to the 
    full sized images so you can save them to your own PC.

    You are sick of clicking and waiting and right clicking and
    saving to save each image.

 2. Somebody has a list of files of their web site, and you
    want to download them, and, you don't want to wear out your 
    mouse or fingers with all the clicking and messing around 
    to save the files individually.

If you can relate to the above situations, then Internet 
Download Buddy could be just what you need, and it could 
save you time and hassle.

A Step by Step Guide to using this program is contained below.
(See "Step by Step Guide to Using This Program" below ! ;)

To use the program, simply copy and paste in your list of files,
(such as the list of files changed for a new release of MAME), 
enter the base web link, select a directory to save the files to 
on your PC, set any other options you require, and press
the "Download + Next" button to download the first file
and move the selection to the next file.

If you have checked the "Automatic Downloads" checkbox, then
the next file will start downloading when the first file is 
finished, and so on until all files are downloaded.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Internet Download Buddy is for Windows 95 / 98 / NT / 2000 / etc.
This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Why I wrote this Program / Why use this Program :
-------------------------------------------------

I wrote this program primarily because :

(a) Initially, I was worried about the unnecessary traffic on 
    MAKE DK's server(s) as a result of having to view web pages with 
    screen shots, and pages of other detail, when all you 
    need is the resulting ZIP file.

    (I had emailed MAME DK and suggested improvements to their site
    that would have drastically reduced their bandwidth expenses,
    but, alas, these were not implemented).

    So, I wrote this program and offered it to MAME DK and all MAME DK
    users FREE of charge (in my email on 18-Sep-2001).  However, 
    MAME DK did not bother to reply to my emails about the program.

(b) Then, in February 2002, a nice person scanned in some ancient
    Apple 2 magazines (from the early 1980's), but it was a real 
    difficult and slow process to download them (click thumbnail, 
    wait for page to download, right click, save it, press the back 
    button to go back to the index, and do it all over again for 80 
    or so pages for each magazine).

    So, I modified and renamed my program to become a general
    purpose internet download utility.

    And, the next day, it downloaded the other magazine pictures
    for me, and I did not even have to be there in the room
    while it worked its way down the list.

If you find this program useful, or if it saves you time, 
then that is cool !


Step by Step Guide to Using This Program :
------------------------------------------

To use this program, simply unzip it to a directory (using 
PKUNIP, WinZIP, or similar), copy and paste in your list
of files.

Let's now look at some scenarious and step by step situations
where Internet Download Buddy could prove very useful.

*** Note Well Before we Start ***

N.B.  Some WEB sites hide their files within bizare links,
      such as

      http://www.moose.com/downloads/moose/?1000353364|1ce
OR
      http://www.moose.com/downloads/moose/dl.php?moose.zip

Somw WEB sites do this to make it harder for people to download
files so that they can force you to go through all of their
banner ads.  Some sites do this because they don't like other 
web sites linking to their files and stealing bandwidth.
And, other people do this because they are just plain mean.

For these sites, Internet Download Buddy will not be much use,
well, at this stage anyway ...

OK, on with the show.


Scenario #1.  There are a bunch of files listed on a web page 
************  and I want to download them all.

The first thing to do is download one of the files and see 
where it is downloaded from.  Some WEB pages hide this, but 
most do not.  If necessary "View the Source" for the web page
and search for the file you are downloading and copy the link.

OK, let's say that files are all downloaded from :

  http:/www.moose.com/downloads/

OK, so copy and paste this link into the "Source WEB URL"
in Internet Download Buddy.

Next, select where on the PC you want the files to go.
i.e. select the "Destination PC Directory" in Internet 
Download Buddy.

OK, so far so good, now we need the list of files.

	cactus.jpg
	flower.jpg
	hedgehog.jpg

If so, then just select these files and copy and paste them into
in Internet Download Buddy.

OK, we are now ready to test the download.

Press the "Download + Next" button, and Internet Download Buddy
will download the first file, and then select the next file
ready for subsequent downloading.

When the download is complete, go to wherever your destination 
directory is, and view the file and make sure it is what you
were expecting.

If not, then you may need to use some of the setting we discuss
below, or you may need to check the "Source WEB URL" above,
and that you have enough free disk space in the 
"Destination PC Directory", etc.

If all is OK, then check the "Automatic Downloads" checkbox,
and press the "Download + Next" button, and all remaining
files will be downloaded - one at a time.


Scenario #2.  As above, but descriptions are also listed
************  with each file name.

If the file names have descriptions with them, such as :

	cactus.jpg     A Picture of a Cactus
	flower.jpg     Flower in full bloom
	hedgehog.jpg   Cute but not so cudly

then, you should check "Ignore everything in file name 
after Space, comma, colon, etc" checkbox, so that Internet 
Download Buddy knows to use "cactus.jpg" as the file name 
and not "cactus.jpg     A Picture of a Cactus" as the file 
name.

If all is OK, then check the "Automatic Downloads" checkbox,
and press the "Download + Next" button, and all remaining
files will be downloaded - one at a time.


Scenario #3.  As above, but the file extensions are not 
************  displayed.

If the file names don't have extensions, such as :

	cactus     A Picture of a Cactus
	flower     Flower in full bloom
	hedgehog   Cute but not so cudly

Then, download one of the pictures and see what extension it has.

Let's say the file has a JPG extension.

In Internet Download Buddy, type in "JPG" as the 
"Default File Extension".

N.B.  Some WEB sites are case sensitive, so you may need to 
      change this to "jpg" or "Jpg" or something else for 
      the downloads to succeed !

Then, you should check "Ignore everything in file name 
after Space, comma, colon, etc" checkbox as before,
and this will enable Internet Download Buddy to work
out that"cactus.jpg" is the file name and not 
"cactus     A Picture of a Cactus".

If all is OK, then check the "Automatic Downloads" checkbox,
and press the "Download + Next" button, and all remaining
files will be downloaded - one at a time.


Scenario #4.  No files are displayed, but they are all based
************  on a pattern.  e.g. pic1.bmp, pic2.bmp, etc

For situations where file names are not displayed or listed,
then check the file names and see if they conform to
a basic pattern.

For example, if the file names were pic1.bmp, pic2.bmp,
... pic15.bmp, etc, then the "Manufacture File List"
functionality in Internet Download Buddy.

As the File Spec, enter :

	pic:n:.bmp

Set the From spinner to 1, and the To spinner to 15,
and Zero pad numbers to at least 1 digit, and
press the "Manufacture File List" button,
and the required list of files should be generated.


Scenario #5.  As above, but file names are pic001.bmp, 
************  pic002.bmp, etc.

As before, enter the File Spec as :

	pic:n:.bmp

And, as before, set the From spinner to 1, and the 
To spinner to 15, but this time Zero pad numbers 
to at least 3 digits, and then press the 
"Manufacture File List" button, and the required 
list of files should be generated.


Hopefully the above walkthroughs help you understand
the program and get the most out of it.

The trick is to download one file, and see how you go,
and play with things till you get it working, and then
download all files.

Tool tips (hints) are provided with all buttons.

Everything is clearly labelled and the program should 
hopefully be fairly straight forward to use.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete the program from your 
computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever you installed
    it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Retrying the download if the file is bad, corrupted, or truncated.

  This means that I will need to know how to integrity check files.  
  For ZIP files this is easy, but for JPEG, Word Document, and other 
  files, this could involve some major work.

- A simpler way to integrity check downloads might be to checksum the file
  on the web server, and checksum it again when the download is complete.

  But, this strategy has many issues.  e.g. CR -> CR/LF conversions
  during downloads of text files from Unix to Windows based systems
  would mean that the checksums never matched.

  A way around this might be to ignore the CR/LF characters during the 
  checksum, but what if it is these that are corrupted during the download ?

  So, as you see, there is no easy answer to this problem.

- Multiple Downloads at once.

- More advanced features.

- Resuming of broken / incomplete downloads.

- Add in an Instant Halt button.  (At the moment, the Halt stops the 
  download at the end of the file currently being downloaded).

- Get the file size from the web server, and display a progress bar 
  (with % download, etc).

- Display the download speed for the current file, and for all files 
  downloaded since the "Download + Next" button was last pressed.

- Subdirectory downloads.
  This program has proven to be enormously useful and time saving 
  for me many times in the past.  And, I have greatly extended 
  this program behind the scenes, adding in the ability to download 
  from sub-directories, etc.  Maybe one day I'll release this
  vastly improved version ...

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

0.001  18-Sep-2001  Very early Private BETA sent to MAKE DK for review 
                    and comment.  I offered to give the program to MAME DK 
                    to save them significant bandwidth costs while still 
                    protecting their banner add income.  
                    They did not bother to reply to my emails.
                    In early March 2002, MAME DK closed down for the second 
                    and perhaps final time because their costs were so high.
                    If only they had listened to my advice and took the
                    FREE help I offered ....

1.0   11-Mar-2002   First Public Release.
                    (21,627 lines of code / comments.)

1.0f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.


If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is possibly an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my WEB page - see below.
