Introduction :
--------------

CPU Fault Detector for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

CPU Fault Detector executes dozens of floating point 
calculations that are known to generate incorrect results 
on some Intel Pentium Processors from the mid-1990's.

If your processor passes the test, then you have nothing 
to worry about.

If your processor does NOT pass the test, then you still most
likely have nothing to worry about.  It is extremely unlikely
that the average user will ever perform a calculation that
will be affected by the CPU flaw.  Users who are into heavy
floating point calculations - 3D games, CAD/CAM, 3D modelling, 
etc may like to change / upgrade their processor if the flaw
is detected in their machine'c CPU.

I have tested dozens of PC's - from slow Pentium 60's on up,
and have never found a CPU with the error(s).  So, it
does not seem to be as widespread as some of the press
reports suggested.  (No suprise there !!)

This program is FREE software - any person and any company is
welcome to copy it, use it, and distribute it as they see fit,
as long as the CPUFLAW.EXE and this text file remain intact.

If you find this program useful, please visit my WEB page
and check out some of the other Freeware or $5 dollar shareware

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Vers    Date        Description
1.0   19-Oct-1999   First Public Release.

1.1   17-Apr-2001   Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (7,677 lines of code / comments.)

1.1b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    The default release of this program is now for Windows 95 / NT
                    or later.  (If you need a Windows 3.x version, let me know).
                    (31,860 lines of code / comments.)
