Talking Clock Sounds		Copyright (C) Moose O'Malley, 
--------------------		May 1997.

The WAV files in this archive are for use with 
Registered versions of my Talking Clock program 
for Windows 3.1, 3.11, 95, NT.

The WAVs are recordings of my pretty crappy impersonations 
of Mrs Doubtfire - a character played by Robyn Williams in
the movie of the same name.

The WAV set features multiple prefix and suffix sound
files - which are supported and played by the
Registered version of Talking Clock.

One of the suffix wavs is my famous "Mrs Doubtfire
sings the Sex Pistols" impersonation, and shouldn't
be missed !!

These sound files are Copyright (C) and cannot be 
edited or modified and no other use can be made of 
them without written prior permission from me.
