Introduction :
--------------

Sort It Out for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Sort It Out is, in a nut shell, a list sorting utility.

I maintain lots of lists - lists of games, lists of emulators,
lists of names and addresses (of friends), lists of this,
and lists of that.  And, I like all my lists to be sorted.
How can you find things in them if they aren't sorted ?

These lists are all kept in Notepad Text files, and I am forever
loading up MS WORD, creating a new document, selecting all the 
text in my Notepad Text list, pasting the list into WORD,
selecting the whole list, selectng the "Table" menu,
selecting the sort text option, specifying the sort params,
doing the sort, copying the text, pasting it back into my 
original list, and then exiting WORD.

A lot of steps and work for a little result.

Now, with Sort It Out, this process is reduced down to 3 steps :
- select and copy the text in your list to the clipboard.
- press the "Sort Clipboard Text" option in Sort It Out.
- paste the sorted text back into your list.

Simple as that !

The following sort algorithms are available :
- Bubble Sort
- Exchange Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Shell Sort
- Moose Sort - a very fast sort but with limitations :
  it must be used for Ascending, case insensitive sorts, 
  where blank lines are removed.

There's also a "Do *NOT* Sort" option in the Sort Method dropdown box.
This is for when you want to process text from the clipboard (and remove 
duplicates, trim off white space, etc according to the other settings) but 
not actually sort the text.
                    
And, you can do all of this with or without case sensitivity, and (when sorting) 
sort in ascending or descending order.

There are other options to :
- auto copy sorted text back to the clipboard (after the processing),
- automatically remove blank lines (during processing),
- show sort in progress (which slows things down one hell 
  of a lot - and I wouldn't do it for long lists).

At the end of the processing, the time taken (in seconds) and the number of 
lines processed are displayed in their boxes on screen.

Sort It Out will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


The Future :
-------------

This is an early release of the program, and several interesting
things could be done in the future :

- Improve the layout of the screen - loads of things can be 
  done here.

- Optimise existing sort algorithms further.

- Add in faster Sort Algorithms, such as Heap Sort and
  Quick Sort.

- Add in the ability to sort on various columns of data.

- Add in the ability to ignore spaces / tabs at the start of
  a line.

- other changes.  Can you suggest any ?


Reviews / Awards / CDs :

None so far.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.0     13-Apr-97   First Public Release.

1.1     15-Jun-97   Save settings automatically on Windows 95 shutdown 
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Start Minimised if set in Shortcut / settings
                    (Registered Users only).  
                    Save Window Height and Width on exit, and 
                    enable Main Window to be resized.
                    Improve application startup - size and position 
                    form before user sees it.
                    Add in Menu items for viewing my Shareware Catalog, 
                    the Readme file, and the Registration Form.
                    Add in a new "Moose Sort" option - very fast but 
                    has limitations - must be used for Ascending, 
                    case insensitive sorts, where blank lines are
                    removed.

1.2     11-Jan-98   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (3,177 lines of code.)

1.3  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    Add in checkbox option to Remove Duplicate entries.
                    Add in checkbox option to auto-minimise "Sort It Out" 
                    following the sort.  Add in checkbox option to Trim 
                    Tabs / spaces at start / end of lines. 
                    Add in an "Exit" button.
                    Fix hanging / locking up of program when clipboard / 
                    sort buffer is empty.  Make "Sorted Lines" and "Elapsed 
                    Secs" edit boxes Read-only. Change the mouse cursor 
                    to an hourglass during the sort.
                    Fix program hanging when the clipboard is empty.
                    Add in an "Exit" button.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's 
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    Add in "Always On Top" functionality - available 
                    from the "File" menu.
                    (8,943 lines of code / comments.)

1.3b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (35,177 lines of code / comments.)

1.3f   3-Sep-2007   This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.

1.4f   3-Dec-2012   Add in the ability to remove leading and trailing spaces, tabs, 
                    etc from every line before it is sorted.
                    Add the ability to remove duplicates from the sorted 
                    results - something I have needed to do a lot of lately.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (67,168 lines of code / comments.)

1.5f  16-Jul-2013   Add in "Do *NOT* Sort" as a option in the Sort Method dropdown box.
                    This is for when you want to process text from the clipboard 
                    (and remove duplicates, trim off white space, etc according to 
                    the other settings) but not actually sort the text.
                    I have needed to do this a lot lately, so I added the functionality 
                    in to this program, Sort It Out.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (54,920 lines of code, comments, and blank lines.)
