Introduction :
--------------

File Patcher for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

File Patcher is a utility that enables you to :

1. Modify a file according to the parameters and values 
   held in a special patch file.  So :

   Original File + Patches = Updated File

2. Compare two files and generate another file describing
   the differences between the two files (i.e. generate a
   patch file).  This patch file can then be used to generate
   the second file from the first at any time in the future.
   (See option 1 above).  So :

   Compare Original File and Updated File => List of Patches

For example, the game Joust, that comes with Williams Arcade 
Classics, can be modified to enable the famous Pterodactyl Bug 
by applying over 180 modifications to the Joust.EXE file.

Clearly doing these modifications by hand with a Nibble Editor
or similar would be extremely time consuming and error prone.

File Patcher enables you to overcome these problems by automating 
the process - provided you have a file listing the required patches.
Also, many other games and applications can be modified and 
improved by applying changes to the EXE / COM or data files.
As an example of why these file patches are useful, consider
Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, or similar applications,
or games (such as Quake, etc).  When released these programs
all contain errors, so instead of sending everyone replacement
CDs so that they can install the fixed software, companies
instead release patches.  These patches contain the changes
to files and are generally much smaller than if you had to
download or re-install the whole program over again.

File Patcher is a program that could be used to apply
such patches to already installed software.

File Patcher is developed using 32-bit Delphi.

File Patcher will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Using File Patcher : Process / Apply Patches
----------------------------------------------

Select files to process.  i.e. File prior to Patching 
and the File after Patching :

1. by clicking on the buttons next to the entry boxes for 
   these items, or, 

2. by typing in the drives, paths, and names directly, or,

3. by dragging and dropping files from explorer (see 
   "Dragging and Dropping Files and File Patcher" below), or,

4. by using the "Select ..." options under the File menu, or,

5. by selecting a "Canned" patch (if you have already set this 
   up) using the "Select Canned Patch" button.

Next, select a Patch Data File - which is a text file 
which already contains the patches to apply to the file to
be patched.

Press the "Process / Apply Patches" button, and that's it - 
it is that easy !


Using File Patcher : Generating a Patch File :
----------------------------------------------

Select files to compare.  i.e. File prior to Patching 
and the File after Patching :

1. by clicking on the buttons next to the entry boxes for 
   these items, or, 

2. by typing in the drives, paths, and names directly, or,

3. by dragging and dropping files from explorer (see 
   "Dragging and Dropping Files and File Patcher" below), or,

4. by using the "Select ..." options under the File menu.

Next, select a Patch Data File - which is a text file 
which will contain the differences between the files.

Press the "Generate Patch File" button, and that's it - 
it is that easy !


Dragging and Dropping Files and File Patcher :
-----------------------------------------------

You can also Drag and Drop of files from Windows Explorer.

This Drag and Drop works in 2 ways :

1. You can drag and drop a single file onto the File prior 
   to Patching, File after Patching, and Patch Data File
   edit boxes.

2. You can also drag one or more files to File Patcher's window
   (Not to one of the edit boxes) and they will be placed into
   each edit box.

So, if you want to drag 2 or 3 files at once, drag them onto 
File Patcher's window.  If you want to drag and drop single files,
then drag and drop them onto the individual edit boxes.

This provides maximum flexibility to users.


Patch File Formats :
--------------------

The format of the individual Patch file (not the Canned 
Patch File - which is discussed below) is 3 Hexadecial 
numbers (with $ prefixes) : the Offset, the Old Value, 
and the New Value seperated by spaces as follows :

- $11856 $20 $49
  $11857 $99 $4E
  $11858 $67 $43

But, as long as there are spaces between the $ prefixed numbers,
then many other combinations will work as well, and
any labels in between will be ignored, such as :

- Offset $11856: From $20 To $49
  Offset $11857: From $99 To $4E
  Offset $11858: From $67 To $43

- Offset= $11856   Old Value= $20   New Value= $49
  Offset= $11857   Old Value= $99   New Value= $4E
  Offset= $11858   Old Value= $67   New Value= $43

would all work fine as well.

The dollar signs followed by hexadecimal numbers - in the 
order offset, old value, new value - are what is 
important - the rest is all ignored.

If the Old Value does not match the value at the specified
OffSet that is about to be changed (patched), then warning 
messages will be displayed to you.

Lines starting with the characters ";", "!", or "#"
are assumed to be comment lines and will be ingored.

Counts of Characters processed, Patches Processed, Patches
Successful, and Patches Mismatched are mainted during the
Patch process.


Canned Patch File Format :
--------------------------

"Canned" Patches need to be stored in a file called 'patches.ini'.

This "Canned" Patch file can contain one or more pre-prepared 
patches.  i.e. they are all stored within a single file and can 
be selected and applied to files without having to have separate 
patch files.

This makes managing patches easier.

The Canned Patch file's format is an extension of the above
Patch File Format, and consists of the following :

- the name of the patch inside square brackets.
  For example :

  [Upgrade Ram Swap v2.9 - 3.0]

- Followed by the name of the Executable or file to patch.
  For example :

  File_to_Patch=ram_swap.exe

- The CRC32 checksum of the file to be patched.  This is optional.
  If you don't know or want to list the checksum, just set this to 0.
  For example :

  CRC32_Check=0

- Followed by a whole series of patches to apply to the file.
  For example :

  Offset= $11856   Old Value= $20   New Value= $49
  Offset= $11857   Old Value= $99   New Value= $4E
  Offset= $11858   Old Value= $67   New Value= $43

- If you want to insert comments into the file, the
  any lines starting with an exclamation mark (!)
  will be ignored and treated as comments.

So, if we had multiple patches within the patches.ini file
then the file might look like this :

[Upgrade Ram Swap v2.9 - 3.0]
!
!  Upgrade the Executable File.
!
File_to_Patch=ram_swap.exe
CRC32_Check=0
! Change the About Screen ...
Offset= $11856   Old Value= $20   New Value= $49
Offset= $11857   Old Value= $99   New Value= $4E
Offset= $11858   Old Value= $67   New Value= $43
! Change the main Window ...
Offset= $192D88: From $50 To $43
Offset= $192D89: From $6C To $44
Offset= $192D8A: From $65 To $20

[Correct MCorp Financial Report]
!
!  Fix some wrong figures in the document.
!
File_to_Patch=MCorp_FinReport.doc
CRC32_Check=32AC1
Offset= $192DA1: From $78 To $20
Offset= $192DA2: From $AE To $21
Offset= $192DA4: From $43 To $20
Offset= $192DA5: From $61 To $50
Offset= $192DA6: From $74 To $72

! Etc for other patches in the file.


In this way, you can build up a whole selection of patches 
within an easily maintainable text file (patches.ini).


OK, so where are the "Patches" ?
---------------------------------

OK, Moose, I like the look of File Patcher, but I can't use 
it without patches.  Where can I get patches ?

Sorry my friend, I cannot provide patches, because these 
could fall into the wrong hands and/or be misused or 
abused by some people.

Such patches could be misused by some people to "crack" games 
or programs that people don't legally own.  

This could land me in hot water and could hurt my fellow 
software developers.

Neither of which I will do or allow.

As such, I will NEVER provide any patches - other than patches
to my own software - to anyone under any circumstances.

Any emails requesting patches will be deleted on sight !

My primary aim for File Patcher is to allow other people to 
generate update patches for programs they develop or documents 
they write.  Then, they can then release a patch for their 
work instead of a new big download.   Virtually all software 
companies release patches / updates for their games / 
applications / operating systems, etc that they develop and 
sell.  

Generating patch files or patch updates or programs to apply 
these patches could be very time consuming.

File Patcher is a program specifically written to help people 
with this.

Also, I use File Patcher personally to help me to remove the 



CD Checks from games I have purchased so that I can play games 
without the CD in the drive.  I hate having to put the CD in 
the drive everytime I play a game.  I much prefer to install 
the game and stick the CD back in the box and put it back 
in my bookcase where it is safe.

File Patcher can also be used to help me patch my software
to provide this benefit.


OAQ - Occassionally Asked Questions :
--------------------------------------

Q. Moose, I need a patch for XYZ.  Can you help ?
A. No.  I will never supply patches to anyone under 
   any circumstances.

Q. Moose, I own game XYZ, but I hate having to stick the CD 
   in the drive to play it, and I hate downloading cracks, and 
   I am too lazy to learn assembler.  Can you help ?
A. No.  I will never supply patches to anyone under 
   any circumstances.

   If you want to remove the CD check from your own games, then
   buy a dissassembler and learn how to program in assembler.
   (It isn't particularly hard - for some games anyway ...)

   Or, failing that, if you are too lazy to do this, then you could 
   always download a "crack" off the internet and patch your games 
   that way.  THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED.

   WARNING: Cracks downloaded from the internet may contain viruses 
            or trojans.  Using these is NOT RECOMMENDED.  EVER !!

   My advice - learn assembler and learn to patch your own programs, 
   or else just keep sticking the CD in the drive.

   Hunting for the CD and putting in the drive is 30 seconds of 
   work, but this is infinitely better than recovering from a 
   virus or trojan attack !!!

Q. Moose, I have a program which has a trial period, or
   is limited to a certain number of runs, or is crippled
   because it's shareware and I don't want to pay for it.
   Can you help ?
A. No.  I will never supply patches to anyone under 
   any circumstances.

   I will never hurt my fellow software developers.

   I will never help anyone rip of a fellow shareware author.

Q. Moose, can you teach me assembler ?
A. No.  I know enough assembler to almost get by, so I would 
   not be a good teacher of assembler.

Q. Moose, can you teach me how to remove the CD Check 
   from games ? (I own them all, I promise !!)
A. No, No, NO !  I will never help anyone do anything suspect 
   or anything that could be misued or abused by others or
   anything that might harm my fellow software developers.

I hate having to put the CD in the drive everytime I play 
a game, so I analyse code and work out what's happening
and remove the CD check for games I own.  

But, I will not help others learn how to do this, because 
this knowledge may be misused or abused.  

Nor will I provide patches to do this under any curcumstances.

I hope this is clear.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- When generating patches, the files being compared must be the same size.
  Improve the program in the future so that this does not need 
  to be the case.

  (Although to be honest, this does worry me - more damage / misuse
  could happen if I ever enabled this functionality ...)

- If you want to generate patches or apply patches on / to multiple files, 
  this this is currently a laborious task, as you need to select each 
  file and the patch file individually and generate or apply patches.  
  Adding in a batch mode to handle groups of files could be very useful.

- Allow the patches to be processed out of order.  At the moment, the 
  patches need to be in the patch file in the order in which they 
  are located in the file.  I don't know why, and no-one has asked for 
  this, but some people might like to process patches in random order 
  or something else rather than the current sequential order.

- Allow Canned Patches over multiple target files - rather than one 
  target file per patch.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.

                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (3,131 lines of code.)

2.2   22-Nov-2001   Add functionality into File Patcher to enable it to
                    generate Patch files as a result of comparing a file
                    with its modified / altered form.
                    Allow the user to choose what labels to insert
                    into the generated patch file.
                    Extend the program so that it can process any number of
                    patches, and make other enhancements - change cursor
                    to hour-glass during processing, etc.
                    Use the directory for the current file as the default.
                    Comma seperate thousands in all sizes and values displayed.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's
                    main window is resized.
                    Add Restore Factory Defaults, Always on Top, and Auto-Run
                    at Windows Startup options to the File menu.
                    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts".
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Brand New About Screen and associated functionality.
                    Add in support for the Maximise icon in the top right
                    corner of the program's main window.
                    This program is now for 32 bit Windows or later.  
                    e.g. Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, etc.
                    i.e. Windows 3.x is no longer supported.
                    (9,643 lines of code / comments.)

2.3  29-Dec-2001    Been doing a lot of File Patching lately - e.g. removing 
                    the CD checking for my new Christmas PC Games ;)  So I
                    have added some improvements in to File Patcher,
                    which has been getting a hell of a work out lately.
                    The default file access method is now Memory Streams
                    which are about faster and better than the Block Read 
                    methods I was using.  (You can still use this though - 
                    see the Settings tab).
                    Work around a bug in the 32 bit version of Delphi which 
                    returns an End-of-File (EOF) character for every single 
                    read operation after an EOF file has been encountered, 
                    even when there is more (non-EOF) data in the file.
                    (Binary files may contain multiple where EOF characters 
                    - anywhere in the file).
                    Add in a Halt processing button - which can be useful
                    when you want to quit processing big files.
                    Numerous little interface improvements.  e.g. images on 
                    buttons, tidying up the labels, tabs, etc.
                    (10,210 lines of code / comments.)

3.0  16-Jan-2002    Big changes - and the program's code has increased by 50% -
                    for this release !!!
                    Add the ability to handle "Canned" Patches in 'patches.ini'.  
                    i.e. a selection of pre-prepared patches that are all stored 
                    within a single file and can be selected and applied to files 
                    without having to have separate patch files.
                    Add loads of additional information into this text file.
                    Add in "OK, so where are the 'Patches' ?" section above.
                    Add in "OAQ - Occassionally Asked Questions" section above.
                    Add in "Using File Patcher : Process / Apply Patches" section above.
                    Add in "Using File Patcher : Generating a Patch File" section above.
                    Add in "Dragging and Dropping Files and File Patcher" section above.
                    Add in "Canned Patch File Format" section above.
                    Enable Drag and Drop of files from Windows Explorer.
                    This Drag and Drop works in 2 ways :
                    1. You can drag and drop a single file onto the File prior 
                       to Patching, File after Patching, and Patch Data File
                       edit boxes.
                    2. You can also drag one or more files to File Patcher's window
                       (Not to one of the edit boxes) and they will be placed into
                       each edit box.
                    This provides maximum flexibility to users.
                    (15,035 lines of code / comments.)

4.0  9-Aug-2002     Add in "Reverse a Patch" functionality, so you can generate
                    the original file from the patched file and the patches
                    applied to it from the patch file.
                    Cater for blank lines in the patch file.
                    Write comments containing File Patcher's name and version 
                    number, my web page's URL, and also list the file names 
                    being compared to the top of the patch file.
                    ESCape key now closes dialogs as you would expect.  
                    e.g. About Form, etc.
                    Add in "Add to List of Canned Patches" button / functionality.
                    Speed up the generation / processing of patch files enormously
                    by updating the screen every 100,000 characters instead of every 
                    100 characters.
                    Enable the user to disable the calculating of checksums when 
                    Generating Patches - this can speed up processing when
                    dealing with massive files.  e.g. I have been dealing with 700 MB
                    files a lot lately - patching and repairing them because they

4.1  1-Sep-2002     Add in a button to enable you to view / edit the Canned Patches
                    File (patches.ini) in Notepad.
                    Change the format of Canned Patches File (patches.ini) slightly 
                    by adding an exclamation point to the start of two fields 
                    as follows :
                        File_to_Patch  ->  !File_to_Patch
                        CRC32_Check    ->  !CRC32_Check
                    There is only 1 registered user of this program, and I have emailed 
                    him and offered to convert his patches.ini file for him to the new 
                    format.  The rest of you freeloaders can do it yourselves !!  ;)
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.

4.2  25-Oct-2002    Fix the checksumming and comparison of *HUGE* files - you 
                    can now checksum or compare or process files of any size
                    regardless of the amount of free memory your PC has.
                    Add in a progress bar for the progress in checksumming 
                    each file.
                    Add in an additional file processing method (FileStreams)
                    behind the scenes and make this *the* method - it is the best 
                    all round method for processing files.
                    (Disable Block Read/Write and Memory Stream methods).
                    Add in some extra validation / checks.
                    Improve some error / warning / confirmation dialogs.
                    Streamline large chunks of code and remove some duplication.
                    Add a "View Patch file" button.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
