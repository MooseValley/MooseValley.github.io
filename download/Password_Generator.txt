Introduction :

Password Generator for Windows 95 / 98 / ME / NT / 2000, 
Vista, 7, 8, 32 or 64 bit, etc.

Password Generator enables you to quickly and easily generate a
random password according to the password rules you specify, such as  
whether the following types of characters are allowed: 
* numerical digits (0-9), 
* lowercase English letters (a-z), 
* uppercase English letters (A-Z), 
* special characters.  e.g. !@#$, etc,

and the minimum and maximum length of passwords.

For example, if you specify 10 as the minimum and 20 as the maximum 
length of a password, then Password Generator will generate a 
password containing a random selection of the characters and digits 
you specified, and between 10 and 20 characters long.

In today's world, it makes good sense to have the strongest possible 
passwords, and Password Generator will help you achieve this.

Password Generator also estimates the strength of each generated password.
By default, the length of a reasonably secure password is 20 characters, 
however, the user can change this to whatever they like, as long as it is 
10 or more characters long.  Passwords less than 10 characters are trivially 
easy to crack and should not be used.

Why have I made the "reasonably secure password length" user definable ?
Because technology is advancing all of the time.  A 20 character long 
password is reasonably secure today, but in 5 or 10 or more years time, 
as computing speed increases and hacker tools become more sophisticated, 
20 characters may not be enough, and 30 or 40 characters might become 
the length of reasonably secure passwords.  By making the "reasonably 
secure password length" user definable, I have made Password Generator 
future proof - because the user can increase the value of this 
setting according to what they deem is reasonable in the future.

You can use the Save and Load buttons to save and load password 
criteria / settings, so you can store the password rules for Facebook, 
LinkedIn, your Bank, etc separately and then re-load these whenever 
you need to generate a new password for each account.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.


Why is this useful ?  /  Why do this ?
--------------------------------------

This program is very useful in our modern world.  As hackers have 
access to ever more powerful computers and ever more sophisticated 
password cracking techniques, using strong passwords for all of 
your on-line accounts and activities is becoming increasingly 
important to protect your privacy, your identity, your reputation, 
your friends and family, and your hard-earned money.


Password Advice - Dos and Don'ts
--------------------------------

Here's my advice on passwords:

* Don't make it easy for hackers, parasites, and thieves - use the strongest 
possible passwords for all of your accounts.
e.g. If a web site has a rule that says passwords must be at least 6 
characters long, then don't be lazy and use 6 character passwords - use 
passwords which are equal to or close to the maximum allowed length.  
e.g. 20+ characters.  Also, if passwords up to 20 characters are allowed, 
then don't just use 20 character passwords all the time, because, if a hacker 
knows this, their job of guessing your password just because a lot easier.
They just need to try all combinations of 20 characters.  Still a massive 
job, but a lot easier than trying all combinations of 10 characters, 
and then all combinations of 11 characters, and so on.  If the maximum 
is 20 characters, then use passwords between, for example, 15 and 20 
characters to make it as hard as possible for hackers to guess.

* Don't just use words or names - these are too easy for hackers to guess.  
And, don't just add numbers or dates onto words and names, because 
these are also way too easy for hackers to guess.  

* Don't use passwords that are easy to guess.

* Never re-use passwords or usernames.

* Don't re-use the same password or username for different accounts.  
e.g. don't use the same password for Facebook and LinkedIn - you are begging 
for trouble if you do !  If one of your accounts is hacked, the hacker 
will have access to your other accounts - not good news for you at all !

* Change your password regularly.  e.g. weekly for really sensitive or 
important places, such as your on-line bank accounts, or monthly for less 
important places.

* Stay the hell away from public wireless networks or any network with 
no encryption or weak encryption.  e.g. If you don't need to enter a 
password to access a network - it might be Free WiFi at a coffee shop 
or whatever - then assume that all of your usernames, passwords, and 
activities are being watched and recorded by others, because the chances 
are that someone will be.

* If you must use any network with lousy security, change your passwords 
as soon as you get back to a network with decent security.

* Store all of your passwords in a secure place.  e.g. on a strongly 
encrypted USB thumb drive and keep this drive regularly backed up and 
physically secure so no-one can ever get access to it or steal it.

* Keep your laptop / desktop / etc secure and up-to-date with the 
latest operating system patches, and keep your data protected with 
decent, up-to-date virus and malware protection, firewall, and 
related tools (VPN, etc).

* Encrypt ALL of your computer storage, harddrives, thumb drives, 
and backups with strong passwords, so that they will be inaccessible 
(as far as possible) if they are stolen or accessed.

* Be paranoid.  Always ask yourself "what can I be doing to better 
protect myself ?".  If you one of your accounts is hacked, learn 
from it and make sure you improve your security from now on.

Anyway, I could go on and on about security, but that's probably 
enough for now. ;)


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply unzip it to a directory (using 
PKUNIP, WinZIP, or similar), and run it.  e.g. double click on the 
"Password Generator.EXE" file.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Support for non-English character sets.  

NOTE: you can do this now via the "Use these Special Symbols" data entry box.
Enter whatever characters you like in this box and they will be used.

- Keeping track of when you last generated a password of the particular type.

- Reminding / prompting you when it is time to generate a new password.

- Strategies to thwart hackers who know the password rules.  e.g. if a web 
site only allows passwords with letters, digits, and a few special symbols, 
such as @, #, and $, and the hackers know this, then they can tailor their 
attacks to use these characters and apply the same probability to each 
character.  However, by adjusting the probabilities for some characters, 
it can make things more difficult for the hackers.

NOTE: You can do this now, to an extent, by adding characters to the 
"Use these Special Symbols" data entry box.  For example, if a web site 
only allows passwords with letters, digits, and a few special symbols, 
such as @, #, and $, then you can add duplicates any allowed characters or 
letters or numbers to the "Use these Special Symbols" data entry box.
For example, the "Use these Special Symbols" data entry box might 
contain:
	@@####$$$$$$Kk99
to manually adjust the probabilities for characters you select, making 
a hacker's job potentially more difficult, because they will be relying 
on the fact that all characters have equal probability. 

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.
