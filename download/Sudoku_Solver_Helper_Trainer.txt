Introduction :
--------------

Sudoku Solver Helper Trainer is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, 
netbooks, etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which 
includes Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

At its core, Sudoku Solver Helper Trainer solves sudoku puzzles,
and it does this exactly how I personally solve the puzzles.
When I solve sudoku puzzles, I work out and write down the numbers that 
can go into each row, column, 3x3 box on the paper next to the puzzle,
and then work out which numbers cannot go into each row, column, etc,
and then solve the puzzle based on this information.  I wrote this 
program to solve the puzzles exactly the way I do it.

However, this is only the start.  Sudoku Solver Helper Trainer can do 
*lots* more.  

Sudoku Solver Helper Trainer provides functionality to:
* Solve Sudoku puzzles.  :)
* Give you hints on the next best "move" you can make to solve a 
puzzle (the program highlights the cell without giving you the answer).
* Displays the numbers that still need to be placed in each row, column, 
and 3x3 box, so you don't need to write this down and keep track 
of this on paper.  This makes solving puzzles *much* quicker and 
easier, because my program does this tedious work for you !!
* Solve the next cell / make the next move (the program highlights and 
solves (fills in the answer) for the next best move).
* Solve all cells / make all moves until the puzzle is solved or until 
the puzzle is deemed "unsolvable".
* Saves and loads puzzles to/from file (a bunch of puzzles are included 
with the program to get you started).
* Solves "unsolvable" puzzles by "Brute Force" methods.  That is, 
the program guesses a number and then tries to solve the rest of 
the puzzle.  If this doesn't work, then Sudoku Solver Helper Trainer 
will back track, guess a different number at this cell or go to 
another cell and try numbers and keep trying until the puzzle is solved.

Sudoku Solver Helper Trainer includes a selection of more than 
25 Sudoku puzzles: easy, medium, hard, and evil.

Sudoku Solver Helper Trainer can help you and show you how to solve 
sudoku puzzles so that you become better and faster at solving them 
yourself.  It sure helped me !  :)

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Why I wrote this program ?  What can it do ?
--------------------------------------------

I wrote the first version of this program many years ago, 
back in 2005, way back when the Sudoku craze was sweeping 
the world.  At this time, my friends and I were very keen Sudoku 
solvers, and I had a white board setup in my house on which I 
would solve sudoku puzzles.

I wrote the program to help me solve some of the more difficult puzzles, 
and to help me become better at solving the puzzles.  At the time, there 
was nothing available on the internet (that I could find) that solved 
sudoku puzzles.

My program soon solved the puzzles and did so much more - gave hints, 
solved the next move, etc.

Then, in October 2013, I was going through some of the programs I had 
written and never released onto my web page (there are dozens of these),
and, after getting lots of encouragement from friends and family, I
decided to dust off my Sudoku Solver program, clean up the code, bring it 
over to my latest code base, tidy up the user interface, and add in 
lots of extra functionality (Undo, Undo ALL, Stats, Save button, Copy All 
button, Reset button, etc), and release it onto my web page.

Until 31-Oct-2013, I always planned to release the program as FREEWare.  
However, friends and family convinced me to release a TRIAL version of the 
program for FREE but charge $20 for the Full version.  

I decided to charge just $10.

I'm under no illusions.  I've been a shareware author since mid-1996, so 
I know human nature *very* well.  I'd be surprised if anyone pays the 
lousy $10, but I'd sure love to be proved wrong.  :)

Update 18-Feb-2015: 
* Due to a complete lack of encouragement and support, this program is 
  now FREEWARE.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\sudoku\ - and run the executable 
file : Sudoku_Solver_Helper_Trainer.exe.

The first time you run this program, the sudoku grid will be empty,
so you can either:

* click the "Load" button and select one of the puzzles included 
with this program.

* Or, click on a cell and enter a number between 1 and 9, and then 
click another cell and enter another number, and so on.
When you have the puzzle into a state in which you want to save it, 
click the "Save" button and enter a file name or select an existing 
puzzle file to overwrite.

You can click cells in the grid to enter / change existing numbers, 
or use the "Solve Next", "Hint", "Undo" and other buttons to work 
through the puzzle either on your own or with help from the program.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete this program from your computer, then:

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever you installed
    it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !


Sudoku Puzzle ".SOD" Data File Format
--------------------------------------

Sudoku Solver Helper Trainer saves its sudoku puzzles in
files with a ".SOD" file extension.

The format of these files is *very* simple - just a plain 
text file with 9 rows of 9 digits, separated by commas, 
for example:

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,9,
7,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,
0,1,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,
8,0,0,0,3,6,7,0,2,
0,0,0,9,0,5,0,0,0,
9,0,1,2,8,0,0,0,3,
0,0,9,3,0,0,0,5,0,
0,0,5,6,0,0,0,0,4,
2,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

If you want, you can also add comments into the file by including
the '$', '!', or '#' anywhere on the line, for example, you can 
include some comment lines that provide information about the puzzle 
(for example, say where it came from, etc):

#
# http://www.websudoku.com/
# Evil Puzzle 6,269,965,969 
#
0,4,0,0,0,7,0,0,9
0,6,9,0,1,0,0,7,0
0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,4,9,0,0,0,0,5
0,0,0,4,8,5,0,0,0
5,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0
0,1,0,0,9,0,8,5,0
7,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,0


If you want, you can enter new puzzles straight into a plain 
text file using Windows Notepad or similar and save the file 
with a ".SOD" file extension.  e.g. My_Puzzle.sod

And that's all there is to it.  :)


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Improve the brute force method I am using.  There are limitations
  with how I have implemented things, and if my program cannot 
  solve the puzzle the program by just guessing a single number for 
  all empty cells and then trying to solve the puzzle, then it 
  deems the puzzle unsolvable.  I've got lots of ideas for improvements 
  here so that my program will solve even the most evil and difficult 
  sudoku puzzles.

- Automatic generation of beginner, novice, and advanced puzzles.

- Support for other variations of Sudoku, such as Hexadoku (I think 
  that is what it is called), where the play grid is 16 x 16 cells, 
  instead of 9 x 9 cells, and each cell can have values 0-9 and A-F.
  Or, add support for other variations of the game.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

Like for ALL of my software, how much more work I do on this 
program depends entirely on what support I get, how many 
people use the program.

Amendment History :
-------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0   1-Nov-2013    First Public Release.
                    My very first TRIALware release.
                    (2,301 lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (64,574 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all primary, library, and include files.)

1.1f  18-Feb-2015   This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information" above.
                    i.e. the FULL version of the program is now completely FREE.
                    Add exception handling to the loading and saving of program settings (INI file)
                    so that the program executes and exits cleanly (no error messages produced) even 
                    if running from a read-only device such as a optical disk (CD-ROM, etc) or 
                    there are disk errors or the disk is full and/or the INI file does not exist 
                    and/or it cannot be created.
                    I really hoped this program would become popular and generate interest, that 
                    perhaps even the authors of Sudoku magazines and books might email me and ask 
                    to include my program on cover CDs and/or on their web sites (which I would 
                    have enthusiastically agreed to).
                    But, not a single shred of support or encouragement since this program 
                    was released 14+ months and not a single sale.
                    Maybe I wildly overestimated how popular Sudoku is .....
                    Maybe Sudoku has had its day ....  Or maybe, more likely, nobody cares ....  
                    Anyway, this program is now FREEWARE.
                    (2,382 lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (40,843 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all primary, library, and include files.)


If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is possibly an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my WEB page - see below.
