Introduction :
--------------

Oblotteration is a simple game that runs under the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM).

Oblotteration is my clone of a game called Flood It.

How to Play:
* You start each game in the top left hand corner (the white square).
* Use the colour buttons at the bottom of the screen to change
the top left square (and all horizontally and vertically adjoining
squares with the same colour) to the selected colour.
* The game ends when all squares are the same colour.
* The aim is the end the game in the least possible turns.
* Can you beat the Computer AI ?

This game will run on ANY operating system that is capable of
running the JVM, including desktops, laptops, and tablets running
Windows, Linux, Unix, etc, such as PCs, Macs, Raspberry PI, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company,
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.


Using this Program :
--------------------

Download and install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for
your machine / OS (if it is not already installed on your machine):

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Extract the contents of the Oblotteration.zip file you
downloaded my my web site to a folder on your machine.

And then, double click on:

	Oblotteration.jar

icon / file to run the game in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

These buttons are provided:
* AI Solve Next: my computer algorithm will make the best move.
* AI Solve All:  my computer algorithm will solve the entire grid.
* Start: start a new game.
* Re-Start: the game currently in progress or the game you have jusgt completed.
* Undo: undo your last turn.  You can undo as many times as you like (right back to the start of the game).
* Help: display a help / about screen.
* Exit: exit and close the Oblotteration program.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Use symbols (A,B,C, etc) instead of colours so that people with
  impaired vision can play the game.

- Allow people to select the colours / symbols they want to use.

- Allow people to specify the grid size, number of colours, etc.

- Levels, challenge levels, etc.

- Smarter computer AI.

- Different modes of play, 2 or more Players, etc.

- Sound effects.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.
