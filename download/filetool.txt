Introduction :
--------------

File Tools for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

File Tools provides some very useful functionality :

- Ever wanted to grab the list of files from the current directory ?
- Ever needed to get the long or short directory path from
  the current directory ?
- Ever wanted to stamp all files with the current date and time ?
- Ever been frustrated with virtually un-readable text files from 
  MAC or UNIX environments and wished you could make them readable 
  on your PC ?  (More on this below with examples !).
- Ever needed to convert long file names to short DOS standard (8.3)
  file names or vica versa ?
- Ever needed to search inside a bunch of ZIP files ?
- Ever needed to test the integrity of a bunch of ZIP files ?
- Ever needed to rename a bunch of files ?
- Ever needed to search and replace the contents of a bunch of files ?
- Ever needed to Word Wrap all lines in a file or remove the 
  word wrapping of lines in a file ?
- Ever needed to change File Access Attributes ?
- Ever needed to count the occurence of all characters 
  in a file or a bunch of files ?
- Ever needed to count the number of lines, words, or characters in 
  a plain text file or a bunch of plain text files ?
- Ever wanted to rename file names to Uppercase, Lowercase, or 
  Title Case ?
- Ever wanted to replace underscores with spaces and vica versa, 
  or replace minus signs with spaces and vica versa in file names ?

- And have you ever wanted to be able to do any or all of this 
  at the click of a button ?

If your answer is "Yes" to any of these questions, then
File Tools is could be what you are looking for.

File Tools supports full "Drag & Drop", so you can drag and
drop bunches of files onto File Tools from Windows Explorer.
(File Tools will automatically scan for and remove duplicates !).

See "Walkthrough with Examples on Using File Tools" below
for descriptions, examples, and further details on all 
functionality provided by the program.

Once the program has been run at least once on your computer, 
and you have installed the registry changes (under the File menu)
then you can also start File Tools by selecting a file in Windows 
Explorer and right mouse clicking and selecting the "File Tool" 
option from the popup mouse menu.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

File Tools for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a directory - 
such as c:\filetool - and run the executable file filetool.EXE.

Simply drag and drop files onto File Tools from Windows
Explorer and then click the buttons needed to perform
the particular processing you need.

Once the program has been run at least once on your computer, 
you can also start File Tools by selecting a file in Windows 
Explorer and right mouse clicking and selecting the "File Tool" 
option from the popup mouse menu.

I recommend that you also create a Shortcut to FileTools.EXE 
in the Windows "Send To" folder so that you can select
a bunch of files in Windows Explorer, right-click on them,
select the "Send To" option and then select "File Tools".
This will cause File Tools to load and automatically load 
the list of files you want to work on.

At the moment, when you double click on a file in the list, 
it always loads it into Windows Notepad - regardless of the 
type of file.  It would be much better to kick of WinZIP for 
ZIP files, WORD for DOC files, etc.

In future versions, I will be able to improve on these features.
(Refer to: "The Future" section below.)

See "Walkthrough with Examples on Using File Tools" below
for descriptions, examples, and further details on all 
functionality provided by the program.


Installing this Program :
-------------------------

To install  this program, simply unzip the contents of the 
distribution ZIP file to a directory (using PKUNIP, WinZIP, 
or similar), run the Filetool.EXE, drag and drop files from 
Windows Explorer onto FileTools, and then click on the 
buttons to perform the activities you require.

Everything is hopefully clearly labeled and the program 
should hopefully be fairly straight forward to use.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall program for File Tools.

If you ever want to delete File Tools from your computer,
then :

 1. Uninstall Registry Changes (Only necessary if you ever Installed
    the Registry Changes), via the "Uninstall Registry Changes" 
    on the File menu.

 2. Then exit File Tools, and delete it from wherever you installed
    it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !


Walkthrough with Examples on Using File Tools :
-----------------------------------------------

OK, let's assume that you have run File Tools, and have 
dragged and dropped these files from Windows Explorer
into File Tools :

	C:\temp\File Tools Test 1.txt
	C:\temp\aaa\File Tools Test 2.txt


"Directory Path View" on the "Other" tab :
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

File Tools will display the Directory Path if the 
"Directory Path View" is set to "Show", otherwise, 
you will only see the list of files without their 
directory paths.

If paths were set to "Show", the you would see :

	C:\temp\File Tools Test 1.txt
	C:\temp\aaa\File Tools Test 2.txt

otherwise (with paths set to "Hide") you would see :

	File Tools Test 1.txt
	File Tools Test 2.txt


"Filename View" on the "Other" tab :
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In addition, view short (DOS compatible) or long file 
names depending on whether you have selected "Short" or
"Long" in the "Filename View".

With "Long" selected and "Show" paths, you would see :

	C:\temp\File Tools Test 1.txt
	C:\temp\aaa\File Tools Test 2.txt

but with "Short" selected, you would see :

	C:\temp\FILETO~2.TXT
	C:\temp\FILETO~1.TXT


Copy to Window's Clipboard (Main Window) :
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this group box, there are the following buttons :

- File List - copies the list of files to Windows clipboard
  as they appear in the list according to your 
  "Directory Path View" and "Filename View" settings.
  e.g. If "Long" filenames and "Show" paths is selected, then
  the list of files with long file names and full directory paths
  will be copied to Windows Clipboard.

- Short Paths - builds a list of the DOS standard short filename
  paths for every file in the list.  If all files are in one directory,
  then only one directory will be copied to Windows Clipboard.
  If the files in the list are in 5 directories, then 5 directories 
  will be copied to Windows Clipboard.

- Short Paths - builds a list of the long filename paths for every file 


  in the list.  If all files are in one directory, then only one directory 
  will be copied to Windows Clipboard.  If the files in the list are in 
  5 directories, then 5 directories will be copied to Windows Clipboard.


Rename File Names (Main Window) :
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here you can type in how you want to change a file's name, and then 
press the "Rename" button, and files that match the specification 
will be renamed as you specify.

For example, if our File List contained these files :

	C:\temp\File Tools Test 1.txt
	C:\temp\aaa\File Tools Test 2.txt


And I wanted to rename "Tools" to "Helper", then I could enter 
these changes into the edit boxes provided, and press the "Rename"
button, and the files would then be called :

	C:\temp\File Helper Test 1.txt
	C:\temp\aaa\File Helper Test 2.txt

Also, see the "Rename Tab" below

Search and Replace File Contents (Main Window) :
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With this functionality, you can search for particular strings 
in files and replace these with something else.

WARNING : Using this functionality to change the contents of 
          BINARY files - such as EXE files or Word Documents, etc
          could have disastrous effects - do NOT do this.

          This function is intended for use with plain text files.
          i.e files that you can edit using Windows Notepad.
          Using this functionality with other file types is for 
          Advanced Users only.

          Always backup files before using this functionality !!

OK, that's the warnings out of the way ... ;)

With this functionality, you can change the text within files.


General Tab Functions :
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Using functions on this tab, you can :

- Reset List :
  Reset the list of files.



- Checksum :
  Checksum all files in the list - and generate a simple report of 
  this information.

- Count Characters :
  Count all the occurence of all characters in the Extended IBM-PC
  ASCII character set (255 characters) in all files in the list - 
  and generate a simple report of this information.
  With this information, you can see how many times - for example - the 
  letter "Z" appears in all files in the list.

- Count Lines :
  Count all Lines of text within in all files in the list - and generate a 
  simple report of this information.

- Count Words :
  Count all Words within in all files in the list - and generate a 
  simple report of this information.  e.g. This sentence "Hi there, Mike"
  contains 3 words.

- Date/Time Stamp :
  Set the last modified date and time to the current system date and time 
  for all files in the list.

- DOS Prompt :
  If there are no files in the list, then a DOS command window is opened 
  in the c:\ root directory.

  If there is one file in the list, or if there are multiple files in the 
  list all from the one directory, then a DOS command window is opened 
  in this directory - whatever it may be.

  If the files in the list are from multiple directories, then a list of 
  unique directories is displayed, and you can select one and a DOS 
  command window will be opened in the selected directory.

- File Size Report :

- Unix to Dos :
  Converts Unix or Mac based text files to IBM-PC compatible text files,
  so they are readable with Windows Notepad and similar text 
  editing / viewing programs.  See "UNIX CR Only Text Files - An Example" 
  (below) for further information.

- Un-Word Wrap :
  Un-Word Wrap the contents of all files in the list.

  WARNING : Using this functionality to change the contents of 
            BINARY files - such as EXE files or Word Documents, etc
            could have disastrous effects - do NOT do this.

            This function is intended for use with plain text files.
            i.e files that you can edit using Windows Notepad.
            Using this functionality with other file types is for 
            Advanced Users only.

            Always backup files before using this functionality !!

- Word Wrap :
  Word Wrap the contents of all files in the list.

  WARNING : Using this functionality to change the contents of 
            BINARY files - such as EXE files or Word Documents, etc
            could have disastrous effects - do NOT do this.

            Advanced Users only.

            Always backup files before using this functionality !!

- ZIP Search :
  With this functionality, you can search all ZIP files in the list 
  for particular files - by file name or by CRC.

- ZIP Test :
  Test the integrity of all ZIP files in the list of files.


Rename Tab :
++++++++++++

Using the options on this tab, you can change file names to :
- UPPER CASE
- lower case
- Title Case

and you can also change file names by replacing :
- Underscores with Spaces
- Spaces with Underscores
- Minus Signs with Spaces
- Spaces with Minus Signs
- Underscores with Minus Signs
- Minus Signs with Underscores


UNIX CR Only Text Files - An Example :
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the UNIX world, there is only a Carriage Return at the end
of a line of text, but in the DOS / Windows world there is a
Carriage Return and Line Feed at the end of a line of text.

If you ever get a text file from a UNIX system, you will 
quickly recognise it, because it has ugly black boxes in
amongst the text and it isn't formatted right.

For example, it will look like this :
  
  With File Tools,this text would be readable in a snap !

instead of :
  
  With File Tools,

  this text would be readable in a snap !

Which is how the text looks after File Tools has fixed it !!

Similar problems happen with text files transferred from a MAC.

File Tools will convert the text files from these all MAC and
UNIX sources to once again be readable !!

Converting text files from MAC or UNIX environments makes them
readable.

However, converting all the CRs to CR/LFs in a binary file
(such as an EXE or ZIP or Word DOC or Excel XLS or similar 
file) will cause corruption of the data in this file.

ONLY CONVERT TEXT FILES !!!

NEVER CONVERT BINARY FILES !!!

If you need more information on this, please Email me.

WARNING : Using this functionality to change the contents of 
          BINARY files - such as EXE files or Word Documents, etc
          could have disastrous effects - do NOT do this.

          This function is intended for use with plain text files.
          i.e files that you can edit using Windows Notepad.
          Using this functionality with other file types is for 
          Advanced Users only.

          Always backup files before using this functionality !!


Set File Attributes (Other tab) :
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using this functionality, you can set the file attributes 
for all files in the list to one or more of the following :
- Read-Only
- Archive
- System
- Hidden


Right Mouse Click Menu :
++++++++++++++++++++++++

After selecting a file (or multiple files in the list of files),
you can right mouse click on the and 

  - Remove Selected File(s) from List

  - Remove all but the Selected File(s) from List

The list of files is multi-select enabled so you can select 
a single file or multiple files by holding down the SHIFT key
just as you can in Windows Explorer.


Special Thanks to :
-------------------

The ZIP Testing functionality for this program was mostly supplied by :

    Info-Zip:    http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/
    Delphi Zip:  http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Orchard/8607/

I would like to thanks the developers of these products for making great 
FREE ZIP tools and utilities.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Storing the program in the Windows Tray Bar - with the clock, 
  etc.

- Automatically create a File Tools shortcut in the "Send To"
  menu (displayed when you right click on a file in Windows 
  Explorer).

- Tie File Tools in with Windows Explorer, so when you select
  a group of files and right click on them, then File Tools is 
  an option on the popup menu displayed.
  At the moment, File Tool only works with a single file - if you 
  select multiple files and right click, you get multiple copies of
  File Tools running - each with a single file in them - which
  isn't satisfactory.  But, it is the best I could do for now.

- Check if a file is a Text File before allowing it to be
  converted from UNIX (CR) to DOS (CR/LF).  Checking if a file
  is a text file and getting it absolutely correct is not 
  easy - even WinZip gets it wrong somethimes !!

- Add in support for ARJ, TAR, and other types of compressed files.

- Add in functionality to perform Backups.

- Add in an "Edit / View" Text file option - with support for huge
  text files.  (Rotten Windows Notepad !!)

- Add in smart file handling.  At the moment, when you double click on
  a file in the list, it always loads it into Windows Notepad - 
  regardless of the type of file.  It would be much better to kick
  of WinZIP for ZIP files, WORD for DOC files, etc.

- Command Line mode.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :

Ammendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0  22-Feb-2000    First Public Release.
                    (11,672 lines of code / comments.)

1.1  29-Feb-2000    Save and Load previously used File list to the same
                    directory where File Tool is installed.  Also, if
                    File Tool is run by selecting a file, right mouse 
                    clicking and choosing "File Tool" or the 
                    "Send To ..." menu, then do not load the previously 
                    used file list.  Save the settings INI file in 
                    File Tool's directory, rather that in the Windows' 
                    directory - there's enough crap there already ! ;)
                    (11,676 lines of code / comments.)
                    
1.2  29-Mar-2000    Re-design the user interface - hope you like it !
                    Add in "Restore Factory Defaults" menu option, to restore
                    the size and shape of the application to what it was when 
                    it was originally downloaded.  Add in "Set / Change File 
                    Attributes" functionality.
                    (12,016 lines of code / comments.)

2.0  29-Jan-2001    Big changes for this release !!
                    No longer make registry changes automatically when the user runs
                    File Tools for the first time.  Installing and Uninstalling
                    Registry changes - along with a full description of the benefits 
                    that this provides - are now user selectable menu options available 
                    under the Install and Uninstall Registry Changes menu options under 
                    the File menu.
                    Registry changes enable you to right mouse click on a file in Windows
                    Explorer and select "File Tool" from the popup menu to send the file
                    to File Tools.  (This only works for single files at the moment).
                    If you ever want to delete File Tools from your computer,
                    then "Uninstall Registry Changes", then exit the program, and
                    then you can delete the File Tools from your harddrive.
                    Add in a "Copy to Windows Clipboard" button on the error dialog.
                    Add in "Always On Top" menu option / functionality.
                    Add in support for ZIP files with DeflatN compression.
                    Add in a "Checksum Files" button, which calculates WinZIP compatible 
                    CRC 32's on all files in the list.
                    Add in functionality to Word Wrap or remove Word Wraps on 
                    text files.  (This will make it much easier to move a text file
                    into a WordProcessor document, and vica versa).
                    (14,845 lines of code / comments.)

2.1  17-Apr-2001    Add in a "Char Count" button to enable you to count the
                    the occurence of all characters in one or more selected 
                    files, and display these counts in a simple report.
                    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.

                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (16,059 lines of code / comments.)

2.2  20-Jan-2002    Add in Line Count functionality for plain text files.
                    Make all Yes/No and OK/Cancel dialogs Confirmation dialogs  
                    instead of Information dialogs.  (This basically changes the 
                    dialog heading and logo used on the dialog - a minor change, 
                    but it clarifies things).
                    Add in a whole raft of new functionality to rename files : 
                    Uppercase, Lowercase, Title Case, replacing underscores with 
                    spaces and vica versa, and replacing minus signs with spaces 
                    and vica versa.  (You could always do this with the existing 
                    "Rename Files" functionality but it is now as easy as clicking
                    a button).
                    If a file used last time the File Tools was used is missing 
                    then remove it from the list, instead of replacing it with 
                    'ERROR' in the list.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (18,108 lines of code / comments.)

3.0  25-Sep-2002    Massive changes for this release !!
                    Add Word Count functionality to count the number of words 
                    in all files in the list.  All files in the list will be 
                    treated as plain text files.
                    Add in a "File Size" report and functionality.
                    Add "DOS Prompt" functionality to enable you to open a DOS 
                    Command Prompt in any drive or directory for any of the 
                    files in the list of files.  Very useful if you need to drop
                    down and work in DOS on any of your files !!
                    Add in 2 additional "Quick Pick" file renaming options
                    "Underscores with Minuses" and "Minuses with Underscores".
                    Add in "ZIP Search" functionality which allows you to search 
                    within  all ZIP files in the list of files, and find all ZIP 
                    files that contain files with a particular name or CRC or part 
                    of a name or CRC.
                    Files that no longer exist between runs are removed from the
