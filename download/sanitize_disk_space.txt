Introduction :
--------------

Sanitize Disk Space for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc.

Sanitize Disk Space is a program that will overwrite the data in all 
deleted files to make it difficult (or even impossible for the highest 
sanitization levels) for even the most skilled hackers to view / recover 
the data in these files.

You should sanitize your disk space BEFORE selling / disposing of your computers, 
desktops, laptops, etc so that others cannot access the data in your deleted files !

NOTE: Only deleted files will be overwritten.  No other files will be affected.

There are two (2) versions of this program:

(1). Sanitize_Disk_Space.exe
The Windows version with the nice graphical user interface (GUI).
See "Using the Windows GUI Version" below.

(2). Sanitize_Disk_Space_CL.exe
For running in the Windows Command Line only.  
This program will NOT run from pure DOS - it needs Win32.
See "Using the Windows Command Line Version" below.

All versions are provided on my web page - select / use the one(s) that suit you best.

Sanitize Disk Space enables you to select any writable drive connected 
to your PC, such as any USB thumb drive, external harddrives, network 
drives, or any of your PC's harddrives or harddrive partitions,
and then sanitize the free / unused space on this drive.

The following sanitization levels are supported by this program :
- Prepare for Drive Imaging (1 pass)
- Basic / Quick             (1 Pass)
- Medium                    (3 Passes)
- High                      (9 Passes)
- Industrial Strength       (20 Passes)
- Department of Defense     (35 Passes)
- You've Got to be Joking   (100 Passes)

(See "Sanitization Levels" below for further information).

Once sanitized (at the highest sanitization level), the data in your 
deleted files can never again be recovered, and no hacker - no 
matter how clever - should ever be able to view any data contained 
in your deleted files.

This processing is ideal for use by anyone selling or replacing 
their PC - especially if the PC contained any sensitive or 
personal data.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Some Background Information :
-----------------------------

When you delete a file, the data contained in this file still exists
on the disk, and it can be recovered !!  

Even if you empty the Recycle Bin, the data can still be recovered.  

Even if you reformat your harddrive or floppy disk, the data can still 
be recovered.

This is very easy to do for people with a bit of PC knowledge and some
easily obtainable software.  e.g. Norton Utilities "UnErase".

If you delete your data, empty the Recycle Bin, format your drive, and 
then reinstall Windows and other software from scratch, your previous 
data can still be recovered.  (But, sophisticated techniques will be 
required.  e.g. Norton Utilities "UnErase" will NOT be able to do this,
but it is possible with advanced techniques.  e.g.  Magnetic Force 
Microscopy (MFM), Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), etc.

What is even more worrying is that even data that existed on the 
drive many years ago, and has been erased and overwritten many times 
with new data can still be partly recovered by very determined and 
skilled hackers using advanced techniques : Magnetic Force Microscopy 
(MFM), Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), etc.

This means that if you sell your PC, or leave a floppy disk lying around,
or leave your PC unattended, then people can look into your deleted
files and see at least some of the data that they contained.

If you have tax records, payroll data, medical records for pateints, 
legal records for clients, diary data for patients, credit card 
information, etc - then some or all of this data may be recoverable 
by very determined / skilled hackers.

Even if you have reformatted, repartitioned, overwritten, and 
erased your harddrive many times, some data can still be recovered
using very advanced techniques.

Sanitize Disk Space is a program that can (at its highest sanitation 
level) completely and utterly erase the data in all deleted files 
on any harddrives or floppy drives you select.

Once Sanitize Disk Space has been run (using its highest sanitation 
level), the data in your deleted files can never again be recovered, 
and no hacker - no matter how clever - should ever be able to view 
any data contained in your deleted files.

See "Sanitization Levels" below for further information about this.


Using the Windows GUI Version :
-------------------------------

To use this program, simply run it, select a drive, and press
the "Sanitize" button.  Full and detailed information messages
are displayed, so you will be able to confirm your actions
and see what has happened.

When the "Play Sound" checkbox is ticked / checked, Sanitize Disk Space will 
play a sound over and over again when all disk sanitization processing has 
been completed.  This is to alert the user to the fact that processing has 
completed.  The sound will cease playing when the OK button is clicked.

The "Test Sound" button next to the "Play Sound" checkbox is so you can hear the 
sound and set your volume levels in Windows Volume Controls to suit your needs.

You can check / unckeck the "Play Sound" checkbox and also click the 
"Test Sound" button at any time - even during sanitization processing.  
So, if you want to change the setting or check your volume levels you can 
at any time.  :)


Using the Windows Command Line Version :
----------------------------------------

These are the command line versions:

(1). Sanitize_Disk_Space_CL.exe
For running in the Windows Command Line only.  
This program will NOT run from pure DOS - it needs Win32.

The command line version can be run in DOS / Command Line Batch files, so you can, 
for example, automate the sanitizing of any or all disks at the click of a mouse, 
or add the execution command(s) to AUTOEXEC.BAT files on boot disks to automatically 
sanitize disks when the disks are booted, or type the execution command(s) at the 
Windows command prompt, or schedule the execution command(s) or batch file(s) that 
contain the execution command(s) in Windows to have them run automatically at 
particular time(s) / day(s).

Usage:

	Sanitize_Disk_Space_CL.exe Drive Level

where:

* "Drive" is a single letter for a valid drive on your system. e.g. C

* "Level" is the Sanitisation Level and must be an integer between 0 and 6:
0. Prepare for Drive Imaging (1 pass)
1. Basic / Quick  (1 Pass)
2. Medium  (3 Passes)
3. High  (9 Passes)
4. Industrial Strength  (20 Passes)
5. Department of Defense  (35 Passes)
6. You`ve Got to be Joking (100 Passes)

Example Usage: 

To do a "High  (9 Passes)" sanitization of all free space on Drive C:

     Sanitize_Disk_Space_CL.exe C 3

If you run the program without any parameters (or with anything other than 2 parameters) then 
you will see the Help Screen that displays the above information.

The program will output status messages every after writing every 5% (see "Sample Program Run" 
below).

Basic error checking of is done for the parameters passed to the program.

Why is this useful ?  /  Why do this ?
--------------------------------------

Doing this is particularly useful when you are selling your PC.

Once Sanitize Disk Space has been run (using its highest sanitation 
level), the data in your deleted files can never again be recovered, 
and no hacker - no matter how clever - should ever be able to view 
any data contained in your deleted files.

See "Sanitization Levels" below for further information about this.


Why I wrote this Program ?
--------------------------

I wrote this program to help out a friend who needed a program to 
do this.

In recent TV shows, like 60 Minutes and Today Tonight, etc
there have been lots of reports of spectacular fuck ups by the 
Australian Tax Office - where they have sold their old office PCs 
to the general public, and many people have been able to recover 
strictly confidential tax payer information that was stored in 
"deleted" files on these ex-government PCs.

If the Tax Office had used my Sanitize Disk Space computer program, 
then they would have saved themselves a lot of embarassment.

Indeed, for government agencies like the Autralian Tax Office 
to allow this to happen not only demonstrates their incredible 
incompetence, but also betrays the confidence of all tax payers 
in Australia.


Sanitization Levels :
---------------------

The following sanitization levels are supported by this program :
- Prepare for Drive Imaging (1 pass)
- Basic / Quick             (1 Pass)
- Medium                    (3 Passes)
- High                      (9 Passes)
- Industrial Strength       (20 Passes)
- Department of Defense     (35 Passes)
- You've Got to be Joking   (100 Passes)

For some sanitization passes, random data is written to the drive.

However, for other passes, I use advanced techniques to generate
the bit patterns required to effectively and unequivocally 
overwrite all deleted data.

According to Peter Gutman (See "References and Special Thanks" below) 
it should be totally impossible for anyone to recover any erased data 
from a drive overwritten using the "Department of Defense (35 Passes)"
sanitization level.

However, just to be sure, I have included a "You've Got to be Joking 
(100 Passes)" sanitization level, which surpasses Peter's highest 
suggested sanitization levels.  At this level, it should be totally 
impossible for anyone to recover any data from your deleted files.

As Peter Gutmann states in his paper :
(See "References and Special Thanks" below)

	In conventional terms, when a one is written to disk the 
	media records a one, and when a zero is written the media 
	records a zero.  

	However, the actual effect is closer to obtaining a 0.95 
	when a zero is overwritten with a one, and a 1.05 when a 
	one is overwritten with a one.

	Normal disk circuitry is set up so that both these values are 
	read as ones, but using specialised circuitry it is possible to 
	work out what previous "layers" contained.

	The recovery of at least one or two layers of overwritten data 
	isn't too hard to perform by reading the signal from the analog 
	head electronics with a high-quality digital sampling oscilloscope, 
	downloading the sampled waveform to a PC, and analysing it in 
	software to recover the previously recorded signal. 

	Using MFM (Magnetic Force Microscopy), we can go even further 
	than this.

The levels of sanitization (supported by this program) are 
described further below.

N.B.  These descriptions are also provided when you select a 
      Sanitization Level within the program.


**********************************
Prepare for Drive Imaging (1 pass)
**********************************

The 1st level of sanitization, "Prepare for Drive Imaging (1 pass)", 
just writes xFF to all free space / unused areas of the drive, so that the 
drive will be far more compressable when it is backed up or disk imaged.

The "Prepare for Drive Imaging (1 pass)" option is great if you want to 
create a compressed image or backup of a hard-drive / disk image, because 
the free space will compress down to virtually nothing.  

If you didn't use the "Prepare for Drive Imaging (1 pass)" before backing up, 
then the free areas of the hard-drive would be full of random data / data from 
previously existing files, and this would not compress anywhere near as well 
as a single value written to all free areas of the drive.  

I have selected xFF (which is 255 decimal or 11111111 binary) as the value, 
but any other value would have worked just as well.

So, using this option, how much reduction will you see in your compressed 
backup size ?  It depends on how much free space is on the hard-drive or 
disk you are backing up.  If the disk has 50% free space, then you should 
see something close to a 50% reduction in the disk's compressed backup size 
(depending on what data was on the free areas of the disk before the 
santization was performed).

I added this "Prepare for Drive Imaging (1 pass)" option to Sanitize Disk Space 
because I was creating compressed backups of my various harddrives and 
virtual machine disks, and this option greatly reduced the size of these backups.

NOTE: Data in deleted files will still be recoverable using UnErase and 
similar software techniques.  If you want your deleted files to be 
non recoverable, then perform a higher level of sanitation first, and 
then perform the "Prepare for Drive Imaging (1 pass)" before 
backing up your hard-drive / image.


***********************
Basic / Quick  (1 Pass)
***********************

Data in deleted files will NOT be recoverable using UnErase and similar 
software techniques.  

However, large fragments of data previously written to the disk (including 
data that existed on the disk previously and has been overwritten many 
times by newer data) will be recoverable by determined and skilled hackers 
using advanced techniques : Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM), Scanning Probe 
Microscopy (SPM), etc.

This level of sanitization is the most basic and it can be applied to 
your drives quickly, however, it provides minimal protection for your 
previously erased data.


***********************
Medium  (3 Passes)
***********************

Data in deleted files will NOT be recoverable using UnErase and similar 
software techniques.  

However, significant fragments of data previously written to the disk 
(including data that existed on the disk previously and has been overwritten 
many times by newer data) will be recoverable by determined and skilled 
hackers using advanced techniques : Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM), 
Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), etc.

This level of sanitization will provide more protection for your erased 
data than all other sanitization levels with fewer passes, such as 
"Basic / Quick  (1 Pass)".


***********************
High  (9 Passes)
***********************

Data in deleted files will NOT be recoverable using UnErase and similar 
software techniques.  

However, fragments of data previously written to the disk (including 
data that existed on the disk previously and has been overwritten 
many times by newer data) may be recoverable by very determined and 
skilled hackers using advanced techniques : Magnetic Force Microscopy 
(MFM), Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), etc.

This level of sanitization will provide more protection for your erased 
data than all other sanitization levels with fewer passes, such as 
"Medium  (3 Passes)".


********************************
Industrial Strength  (20 Passes)
********************************

Data in deleted files will NOT be recoverable using UnErase and similar 
software techniques.  

However, small fragments of data previously written to the disk 
(including data that existed on the disk previously and has been 
overwritten many times by newer data) may be recoverable by very 
determined and skilled hackers using advanced techniques : Magnetic 
Force Microscopy (MFM), Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), etc.

This level of sanitization will provide more protection for your erased 
data than all other sanitization levels with fewer passes, such as 
"High  (9 Passes)".


**********************************
Department of Defense  (35 Passes)
**********************************

Data in deleted files will NOT be recoverable using UnErase and 
similar software techniques.  

In addition, it is very unlikely that any data ever written to the 
disk will be recoverable even by the most determined hackers, even 
if they used advanced techniques : Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM), 
Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), etc.

This level of sanitization will provide very high protection for 
your erased data.

This level of sanitization will provide more protection for your erased 
data than all other sanitization levels with fewer passes, such as 
"Industrial Strength  (20 Passes)".


************************************
You've Got to be Joking (100 Passes)
************************************

Data in deleted files will NOT be recoverable using UnErase and 
similar software techniques.  

In addition, it is *extremely* unlikely that any data ever written 
to the disk will be recoverable even by the most determined hackers, 
even if they used advanced techniques : Magnetic Force Microscopy 
(MFM), Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), etc.

This level of sanitization will provide more protection for your erased 
data than all other sanitization levels with fewer passes supported by 
Sanitize Disk Space.


References and Special Thanks :
-------------------------------

The following paper (by Peter Gutmann) was invaluable to me when 
enhancing, developing and verifying this program :

- "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory"
  by Peter Gutmann of the University of Auckland, New Zealand.

  http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec96/full_papers/gutmann/

and I would sincerely like to thank Peter for his work in this area.

His paper was highly readable and, even though much of it was revision for 
me, once I started reading it, I could not put it down.

I have emailed Peter and thanked him for his work and I have offered 
him a free copy of this program.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :
- Log all Sanitizing to a log file.  e.g. record date, time, etc
  that each drive was sanitized.
- Filter out non-writable drives, such as CD Drives, DVD Drives, etc.
- Add in a "Sanitize all Local Drives" option.
- A pure DOS version that will run from DOS boot disks - anyone need this ?
  To do this, I would need to dust off my old Turbo Pascal for DOS disks ....
- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.

                    Add a "Prepare for Drive Imaging (1 pass)" option, which is great 
                    for when you want to back up or image a disk or hard-drive, because 
                    it will minimise the size of any compressed backups.
                    See "Sanitization Levels" above for further information.
                    Also, add a "Play Sound" checkbox.  When this is ticked / checked,  
                    Sanitize Disk Space will play a sound over and over again when all 
                    disk sanitization processing has been completed.  This is to alert 
                    the user to the fact that processing has completed.  The sound will 
                    cease playing when the OK button is clicked.
                    Add a "Test Sound" button next to the "Play Sound" checkbox so you 
                    can hear the sound and set your volume levels in Windows Volume Controls 
                    to suit your needs.
                    The user can check / unckeck the "Play Sound" checkbox and also click the 
                    "Test Sound" button at any time - even during sanitization processing.  
                    So, if you want to change the setting or check your volume levels you 
                    can at any time.  :)
                    Change over to using my "Universal Progress Form" to display elapsed 
                    time, processing speeds, estimated completion time, etc.  This form is used 
                    across many of my programs.
                    GUI: (1,129 lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    GUI: (61,401 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all primary, library, and include files.)

2.2fb 10-Nov-2014   Windows Command Line version.
                    Release a Windows Command Line version of the program - both share/use 
                    this same readme text file.
                    Update some sections of this readme text file.
                    CL: (685 lines of code / comments / blank lines.)

2.3f 18-Jul-2015    GUI Version Update.
                    Add exception handling to the loading and saving of program settings (INI file)
                    so that the program executes and exits cleanly (no error messages produced) even 
                    if running from a read-only device such as a optical disk (CD-ROM, etc) or 
                    there are disk errors or the disk is full and/or the INI file does not exist 
                    and/or it cannot be created.
                    Insert " and " between words in the confirmation dialog 
                    "deletedpreviously" -> "deleted and previously".
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    GUI: (1,164  lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    GUI: (38,929 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all primary, library, and include files.)
