Tetris v1.9 (June 94) for DOS.            by Moose O'Malley

FREE Ware !

This Prototype Tetris program includes various 
levels of play : 
	- Kids Tetris (easy), 
	- Standard Tetris, 
	- Hard Tetris, and, 
	- Nightmare !

This version of Tetris is FREE Ware, and you can
copy, distribute, and use it freely as long as this
message remains intact.

The program operates in character mode only.  i.e. it is not a 
graphical program, so it will work on any monitor : CGA, EGA, VGA, 
etc, and will run on any PC (with an Intel CPU from 8088 to Pentium 
Pro), and with any amount of memory (it only needs a few dozen KB).

It runs on my 8086 640 KB CGA laptop, and it runs (at the same 
speed) on my Pentium 100 / 16 MB / SVGA.

It also runs under Windows 3.1, 95, NT, but as a DOS application.

This program was written in Turbo Pascal v3 / v5 (DOS).

I wrote this version of Tetris in 5 days, after work during 
the week.  The game is still very rough, and it could do with 
a great deal of polishing / enhancing.

If you like this program, please EMail me and let me know.

It may encourage me to make some of the changes listed below.


Future possible Enhancements :
------------------------------

- Windows version - then again, keeping the program in DOS / ASCII 
  means it will run on the very first PC (with 64 KB of RAM and 
  NO graphics capability), and will also run (at the same speed and 
  with the same functionality) on the very latest Pentium machines.
  Not many games / programs out there can claim this !

- 2, 3 or 4 players competing (they have their own areas).

- 2, 3 or 4 players co-operating (all controlling their own pieces 
  in 1 huge area).

- Shape editor to enable you to create your own Tetris pieces.

- Seperate High Score tables for each Level of game play.

- Add in a 'Lines Removed' counter.

- Add in the missing 'T' piece.  (How did I miss it out ??)

- "Get out of the Mess" - start with predefined levels, with layers
  of blocks already in position and the player has to get out of 
  the mess and clear the screen.

- Game play could also be tweaked then - at the moment all other 
  Tetris games out there (that I have seen) stop when one player 
  ends - so a fast player who drops heaps of pieces and ends the 
  game will have a higher score than the slow careful player who 
  has not made a mistake. The slow player should have the option 
  of continuing on to beat the other players score.

- I have also thought of having Arkanoid like power ups - imagine 
  having laser cannons on your falling piece with say 5 shots to 
  shoot out pieces / mistakes below - or a black piece (like the 
  black balls in Arkanoid) that passes through all other pieces 
  and cleans them away.

- You could also have morphing pieces that change shape if a player 
  is too slow in dropping them down, wild card pieces, Larva pieces 
  that flow into any given gap, Acid pieces that eat away other 
  pieces, virus pieces that infect and change the shape of any 
  other peices they touch, and heaps of other tricky things.
  (I have got loads of ideas here !!).

- Sound FX - at the moment sound is only beeps and farts through 
  the PC's internal speaker.  Great sounds and music, with
  in-game speech would make the game much better.

- Then there is modem, network and internet play ........  
  This is tricky and will be weeks / months of hard work and it 
  will probably mean moving from DOS to Windows ....

- The game also needs a lot of polishing and interface enhancing - 
  it is very rough round the edges.

But, the sky really is the limit !!

The above really is a lot of work, and it is unlikely that all
of the above will be done for the first release, and some may
never be done.

The new program will probably cost $5 (FIVE dollars) - like
all of my other Shareware programs !!

If anyone is interested in this program or registering their 
intentions to buy the program when most of the above features 
are added, please let me know !

With enough support, I might be able to start work on the 
project sooner rather than later.
