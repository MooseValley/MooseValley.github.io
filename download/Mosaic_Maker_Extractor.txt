Introduction :
--------------
Mosaic Maker Extractor is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Mosaic Maker Extractor enables you to create mosaics or pull 
them apart again into their component images (tiles).

A mosaic is a big picture made out of lots of little pictures.

So, with Mosaic Maker Extractor, you can create your own mosaics
or extract the tiles from existing mosaics for further use in 
other mosaics.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
--------------------------

I wrote this program because I have recently been reminded 
of my facination with mosaics.

In 2000, I attended an art gallery exhibition that featured 
(among many dozens of paintings) several computer generated mosaics.
e.g. a jet fighter composed of 100's of little jet fighter images.

I thought it would be cool to develop a program of my own 
to generate mosaics like this.  However, because of the many other 
projects I was working on, I shelved the idea.

Then, in early January, 2005, I found a George W. Bush mosaic 
made up of all the US soldiers who had died so far in the 
fight against terrorism.

Although I found this image very distasteful and inappropriate, 
it did  help re-kindle my facination with mosaics.

So, I sat down over a weekend and thought about how to do the job, 
and pretty soon I had developed a very early, primitive program 
to do generate mosaics.

Then, when back at work on Monday, I did an internet search for other 
mosaic making software, and soon found a bunch of programs.
The cheapest of these was $29.95 US.  

None of these programs included on-line help or any other form 
of help or a step-by-step help guide, none were intuitive or 
easy to use, and none allowed you to extract the images from 
an existing moasic, and most were severely crippled and nagged you 
annoyingly when you used them.

So, over the course of the next fortnight, I extended and improved 
my program, made it as easy to use as possible, added in extra 
features that were not in any of the other mosaic programs, 
and added in the ability to extract tile images from mosaics.

The result is Mosaic Maker Extractor.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.

Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\Mosaic_Maker_Extractor\ - and run the 
executable file : Mosaic_Maker_Extractor.EXE.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu 
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete this program 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Before doing this however :

- If you have selected / enabled the "Auto-Run at Windows 
  Startup" option (under the File menu), then you should 
  ensure that this option is not checked / enabled 
  (which you can easily do by re-selecting the 
  "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" option from under 
  the File menu).

- If you have used any of the "Create Shortcut ..." options 
  under the File menu, then you should use the "Delete All 
  Shortcuts" option under the File menu to remove these from
  your system.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

There are many things I could do with this program in the 
future, for example :

- Add the ability to enlarge / shrink the original image - to 
  make massive or minute mosaics.

  Currently, the mosaic image will be precisely the same size 
  as the original image.

- Add the ability to make specific tiles more or less likely 
  to occur in the mosaic.  i.e. change the randomness of 
  particular tiles.

  Currently, if multiple tiles are selected, then each tile has 
  an equal chances of occuring in the resulting mosaic image.

- Add in support for JPG, GIF, etc files.

  Currently, the program only supports bitmap (.BMP) files.

- Anything else ??

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

Depending on how sophisticated the program becomes in the 
future, and how much work I do, I may end up charging a small 
fee to people who wish to use the program.
i.e. it may not always be Freeware.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------
