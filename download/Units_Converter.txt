Introduction :
--------------

Units Converter for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc.

Units Converter enables you very easily and quickly 
convert units between metric, imperial, and other units for 
length, mass (weight), temperature, area, and many other 
categories.

The current version of the program supports 328 units in 
14 categories.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Using this Program :
--------------------

Simply download the ZIP file, unzip it to a directory using
WinZIP or similar, execute the program (unitconv.exe) on
a PC running Windows 95 or later, and select the category of 
units you want to convert, select the from and to units, and 
type in the value you wished converted, and you will see the 
result.

You can copy the converted from / to values to the clipboard, or
use the Copy Format selection at the bottom of the screen to copy 
the conversions to Windows clipboard in a variety of formats, 
for example:

	3.75 Acres (1.52 Hectares)

This is great / useful when you are doing a lot of conversions and 
need to get the results back with a variety of units into your own 
documents or reports.


Why is this program useful ?  /  Why do this ?
------------------------------------------------

This program can save you hours searching through encyclopoedias,
reference books, and the internet.  Unit Conversions can be a little 
complex and confusing, and it is easy to make mistakes when you are 
in a hurry.  Units Converter saves you from all of these issues and 
the hassle.  Many dozens of units are defined in Units Converter 
to allow you to onvert your data quickly and easily.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :
- More Units
- More Categories
- Support for currency conversions ?  All I need to find is a reliable source of 
  currency data that I can download / convert on a regular basis.  
  Know any ?  Let me know.  :)
- Anything else ?  Let me know !  :)


Program History and Special Thanks To Carl Henry and his Unicon
---------------------------------------------------------------

I have wanted a nice, user friendly Units Converter program like 
this since 1980 - long before computers had graphical user interfaces !!

In my Apple ][ days in the very early 1980's, I wrote a Units Converter, 
which was a BASIC program that handled dozens of units in 6 categories.  
However, the Apple ][ was a very primative machine, and my program 
wasn't all that user friendly or useful or accessible.

In 1994, when I first got access to the internet, I stumbled across a 
program called "Unicon", or Universal Units Converter, by a guy called 
Carl Henry, who was based in California.  

Carl's Unicon program was useful and was much like the re-vamped / 
updated version of my old Apple ][ Units Converter program that I 
had been thinking about developing for years.  Carl's $10 US 
registration fee was very reasonable (and very typical for most 
software at this time), but I had no way to tell if his postal address 
was still current - there was only one way to register, 
and that was to send $10 US ($20 Aus approx) through the post.  

Carl's Unicon program did not have enough units or categories for me - 
I needed some more conversions.  Also, Carl's Unicon program was clunky 
to use, and I found a couple of bugs in some conversions .....

Since 1994, every few years, I have searched for an updated version of 
Carl's Unicon program, but to no avail.  I have also occassionally 
searched the internet for similar programs, but could not find any 
that I was completely happy with (or that were better than the ancient 
1993 version of Carl's Unicon).

But, being someone who loves developing software, I decided in 
October / November 2000 to develop an updated version of my original 
Apple ][ Units Converter program, but with a nice graphical user interface
(GUI) for Windows.  I had a spare weekend and it was very rainy stormy 
outside ....  And I thought I'd easily be finished by Monday ....  
I finished the software design and development quickly enough ....  
I had developed a nice program with a great GUI, that adapted its user 
interface based on the data / conversions in a data file.  I was planning 
to release several versions - one with basic units, one with more 
units / conversions, and a 3rd "expert" version that could handle 
every conversion of every unit known to man.  It was a dream of mine to
simplify conversions for all units.

But I didn't take into account the massive data / unit collection job I 
was about to start ....

So, I set about exploring and gathering all of the units and conversions 
I could find.  I set-up a Lotus Improv spreadsheet - because this allows you to 
seprate data and forumulas and use plain english formulas, for example: 
Kilograms = Pounds * 2.2 instead of A3 = B5 * 2.2, and then I searched 
all over the internet and gathered up all of the units I could find - 
whether I wanted them in my program or not.  This process took me many, 
many, many dozens of hours of work, and I have to say that I dissappeared 
down a large number of deep and awful rabbit holes for long a while 
(over a decade).  I soon discovered that world of Units wasn't neat 
and orderly as I had hoped, but there are contradictions, vagaries, and 
confounding information everywhere.  

I also got lost in the scope of the exercise - there are many 1,000's of 
units out there.  

Every few months, I would return to my Lotus Improv spreadsheet and 
do another few hours of research, adding in more units, grathering 
more evidence for confirming the conversions I had gathered so far, and 
gathering new units and conversions.  I was using the internet, as well 
as reference books and encyclopaedias.

Often I'd watch a TV program, documentary, or movie and hear them talk 
about some new unit of measure and think "Ahhh, I'll add that to my 
Lotus Improv spreadsheet ...", and off I'd go and what I thought would 
be a quick bit of research, but it usually turned out to me more complex 
and convoluted, and lead me down numerous other paths for other units, 
and so on.  A quick 10-20 mins of research would frequently turn into 
several hours or more - and with no end in sight.

I remember one area that really stumped me was soldier group sizes: 
battalion, squad, phalanx, etc - I tried to add conversions in for these, 
but the definitions of these terms vary by army, country, period of 
history, etc.  I lost a lot of time here trying to make sense of it - 
but in the end I had to concede that there wasn't any sense to it 
at all.  It was impossible ....

On 20-Nov-2000, I very nearly released v1.0 of my Units Converter.  
But, I wasn't completely happy with it ....  More work was needed on 
tidying up some of the units / data conversions.  I have found so many 
inconsistences and contradictions between information sources, that I 
was not 100% confident that all of my conversions were correct.

Fast forward 14 years later to November 2014 ....  In my Google and 
DuckDuckGo searches in early November 2014, I could find NO mention at 
all of Carl Henry nor his "Unicon" Universal Units Converter program.  
It looks like Carl hasn't released an update for his program for many 
years - and possibly he hasn't released an update since 1993.

Anyway, here we are, 14+ years later, and I am still no-where near to 
completing my Units Conversion Lotus Improv spreadsheet.  In fact, I 
have not done any further work on my Lotus Improv spreadsheet for 
about 4 years now, and I have no plans to go back to it - the job 
was simply too big and too convoluted for one person, especially 
when that person (me) was doing it ALL for FREE and in their "spare time".

So, I have returned my Units Converter program, tidied up the user 
interface, and released it.

As a special tribute to Carl Henry's 1993 "Unicon" program 
(which no longer exists on the internet, as far as I can tell),
I have decided to set aside nearly all of the units / conversions I have
painstakingly collected and researched over the last 14+ years, and instead use
the data file from Carl "Unicon" program, but with some fixes and
21 extra units / conversions and 4 additional unit categories.

Carl's "Unicon" program had 307 units in 10 categories.

v1.0 of my Units Converter program supports 328 units in 
14 categories.

So, I have added 21 units and 4 categories to Carl's original data 
file.  As I said above, I have much bigger (and incomplete) unit 
conversion lists that support many dozens more units.  So, 
I may add more in the future ....
