Introduction :
--------------

Directory Usage Monitor for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Directory Usage Monitor enables you to analyse the
disk space used and the number of files present in a
directory and all of its sub-directories on a harddisk, 
floppy disk, CD ROM, Network Drive, or any other form of disk.

If you have ever asked the questions :
- Where the hell has all my disk space gone ?
- Which directories are using the most disk space ?
- Which user's on a Network drive are using the most disk space ?
- How much disk space is Fred using on the Network Drive ?
- How many files are there in this directory tree ?

Then Directory Usage Monitor could be of great use to you !

This utility could be used by Network Administrators, Systems
Administrators, or by users who need extra disk space or find out
where / what directory is using lots of disk space.


Using Directory Usage Monitor :
--------------------------------

Simply select the Drive and Directory you wish to analyse
and click the "Update Dir Info" button.
Directory Usage Monitor will then work out the disk space
used by the particular directory and all it's sub-directories
and the number of files in each directory.

The "Total of All Directories" (KB used and number of files)
is displayed for the total of all directories under consideration.

If you wish to "Stop" this process at any time, simply click
the "Stop" button.  (This will result in the process being stopped
and the text "*** Aborted !!" appearing in various cells.

You can sort in ascending or descending order on Directory name,
KB of space used, and the number of files present in each 
directory under consideration.


The Future :
------------

Much new functionality can be added to this program in the 
future, such as :

- Make the program a *LOT* more userfriednly.  For example, log 
  the space used by all directories on a disk and then allow the 
  user to instantly drill down and drill up through directory 
  structures, and see the space usage as they go.

- Keep a history of disk space usage so that comparisons
  can be made to see how usage has changed.

- Command Line mode - like Checksum Calculator - so that the 
  program runs automatically at (say) Windows startup.

- Ability to display file sizes in KB, MB, GB, TB.

- Make the application reside on the Windows Tray Bar.

- Add in ability to log all directories on a given drive
  and store this information, so that as directories are 
  traversed are revisited, the data does not need to be 
  logged again.

- For each sub-directory, display the number of 
  sub-sub-directories it has.

- Display the maximum file size, average file size, etc 
  for each directory.

- Format all numbers with a comma thousands separator.

- Anything else ?

If anyone requires any of this or other functionality,
or has any other suggestions, please email me and let me 
know !

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.0   13-Apr-1998   First Public Release.

1.1   01-Feb-2001   Store the INI settings file in the program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    Fix an old bug in Borland Delphi / Windows NT
                    to fix NTDLL.DLL errors on closedown which 
                    occured on some Windows NT configurations.
                    (7,823 lines of code / comments.)

1.2   17-Apr-2001   Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (8,669 lines of code / comments.)

1.2b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (33,104 lines of code / comments.)

1.2f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.
