Introduction :
--------------

Memory Monitor for Windows 3.1, 3.11, 95, 98, NT, 2000.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Developed using 16-bit Delphi.

The program simply displays Free Memory, Free GDI Memory, and
Free User computer memory under Windows, just like Dashboard 95 does.

If you are using Windows 95 / 98 / NT or any 32 bit version of 
Windows after Windows 3.11, then you should use 
"RAM / Swap Monitor" (also available from my WEB page) instead.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.1   19-Sep-1996   First Public Release.

1.2   02-Oct-1996   Fix problem with Menu wrapping on some video cards,
                    which truncated the bottom line of the main window.

1.3   27-Jan-1997   Add in Registration functionality.

1.4   24-May-1997   Save settings automatically on Windows 95 shutdown 
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Start Minimised if set in Shortcut / settings
                    (Registered Users only).  
                    Improve application startup - size and position 
                    form before user sees it.

1.5   16-Jun-1997   Add in Menu items for viewing my Shareware Catalog, 
                    the Readme file, and the Registration Form.

1.6   11-Jan-1998   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (2,369 lines of code / comments).

2.0   18-Apr-2000   Enhance "About ..." window with buttons to
                    copy my email and WEB page address to the
                    Window's clipboard, so user can simply
                    paste them into WEB Browser or Email program.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's 
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    Fix NT Warning Message on Shutdown on some PCs.
                    Store the INI settings file in program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    Add in a "spinner" so you can tell when things are 
                    being updated in the graphs, etc.
                    Add in "Always On Top" functionality - available 
                    from the "File" menu.  (Added especially for 
                    my good friend Patrick Cullinan !)
                    (5,222 lines of code / comments).

2.1   17-Apr-2001   This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.
                    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
       This         component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
     Program        furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
     is now         Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
      FREE !!       Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (7,275 lines of code / comments.)

If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is most likely an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my Home page and its mirrors.
