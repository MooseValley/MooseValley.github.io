Introduction :

ROM Clone Zip Manager for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

In a nutshell, ROM Clone Zip Manager can delete redundant / 
duplicate files from inside Clone ROM ZIPs.  

That is, ROM Clone Zip Manager scans your Clone ROM ZIP files 
(in all directories you specify) and compares each file 
inside these against the files inside the Parent ROM ZIP 
file, and if an identical file is found (with the same 
name and CRC) then it is deleted from the Clone ROM ZIP file.

In adition, you can backup the files (and extract them to
another directory) before they are deleted from inside the 
Clone ROM ZIP file.  

N.B.  The program will only move clone ZIPs.
      i.e. files where the clone ROMs are in their own 
      ZIP file - so if you are using merged sets, it 
      will not split / move these.

The process takes anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes
to run (depending on file sizes), and whether you want files 
backed up before they are deleted from inside the Clone ZIP 
Files.

ROM Clone Zip Manager also enables you to move all Clone ZIP
files to another directory of your choice.

ROM Clone Zip Manager requires a list of Originals and Clone 
ZIP files, and DOS MAME or Windows Command Line MAME can be 
executed from within ROM Clone Zip Manager to generate 
this list.

I wrote this program and ran it against my MAME ZIP files, 
and, in less than 2 minutes, it had saved me a whopping 191 MB 
of disk space (in 3,085 ZIP files originally requiring 
4.41 GB of disk space - a reduction of 4.3%).

WEB sites that host ROM ZIPs should definitely consider 
using this program to clean up their Clone ROM ZIPs
to save bandwidth.  A 4.3% reduction in bandwidth 
costs for a couple of minutes of work is well worth 
the effort !!  ;)

This program is Freeware.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.


Why I wrote this Program / Why use this Program :
-------------------------------------------------

I wrote this program because I was checking out some of 
my largest Clone ROM ZIP files, namely :

- Super Gem Fighter clones, 
- Primal Rage clone, 
- Ninja Warrior (Vampire Hunter) clones, 
- Capcom Sports Club clone, and,
- Cybots clone.

And noticed that the Clone ROM ZIP files for these games
contained many files that were already in the Parent ROM ZIP
files.  I quickly realised that these files sizes could 
be reduced drastically - some to the tune of 18 MB or more - 
simply by deleting the redundant duplicate files.

So, I wrote this program to process these ZIPs.

Then, I extended the program to process all Clone ROM ZIPs
in all nominated directories, and added options to backup
deleted files, etc.

I wrote this program and ran it against my MAME ZIP files, 
and, in less than 2 minutes, it had saved me a whopping 191 MB 
of disk space (in 3,085 ZIP files originally requiring 
4.41 GB of disk space - a reduction of 4.3%).

If you do use this program, please send me an email and let me 
know.  If you like, I will also email you when new versions of 
the program are released.  If I know people are using the program, 
then I am more likely to enhance it further in the future.

If you like this program, check out some of my other arcade emulation
utilities, such as :

  - MAME 32 Tools
  - ROM Chopper
  - ROM ZIP Differences Manager

or some of the other Freeware / Shareware on my WEB site.


Installing this Program :
-------------------------

To install this program, simply unzip the contents of the 
distribution ZIP file to a directory (using PKUNIP, WinZIP, 
or similar), run the ROM_Clone_Zip_Manager.EXE, and click 
on the buttons to perform the activities you require.

Everything is hopefully clearly labeled and the program 
should hopefully be fairly straight forward to use.

This program does not need any DAT files or other files to 
work.  But, it does need DOS MAME or Windows Command Line 
MAME to generate the required list of Originals and Clones.

The default settings for this program are :
- Trial Run - so no ZIP files are altered, and,
- Backup Duplicate Files - so that duplicate files
  are extracted to another directory.

This means that out of the box, the program is 100% safe.

If the program settings are changed from either of these 
safe settings, then you will be prompted to confirm your
decisions before any processing is carried out.


Uninstalling this Program :
----------------------------

To uninstall this program, simply locate the directory where
you installed it (above) - using Windows Explorer or similar,
and delete the entire directory.

This program does not store anything in the Window's Registry
or in any other directory on your PC.


Using this Program - Pt 1:  Originals - Clones List
--------------------------

Press the "Select MAME EXE" speed button next to 
the DOS MAME editbox and select the DOS MAME Executable
or the Windows Command Line MAME.

Then, click the "Refresh Originals / Clones List"
button, and DOS or Command Line MAME will be run with a 
"-listclones" parameter and another parameter to pipe 
the output of this command to a file, which 
ROM Clone Zip Manager will then load, sort, and process.

If the DOS Window does not close automaticaly, then
this means that the DOS MAME Executable does not have
a "Close on Exit" option set.  So, you may need
to close the DOS Window manually.  Or, if you prefer, you 
could right mouse click on the DOS MAME Executable
from within Windows Explorer, select "Properties" 
from the pop-up menu, click on the "Program" tab, 
and check the "Close on Exit" option, and then 
click the OK button.

(I could make this program close the DOS window automatically, 
but I would prefer to allow you to set this or not via the 
peoperties for the DOS MAME Executable - see above - because 
then you can decide whether you want to view your output after 
the programs have been run or not).

You should only need to refresh this list once per MAME
release.

To help you remember when the Originals / Clones list 
was last refreshed, the date and time of the last 
refresh are displayed.


Using this Program - Pt 2:  Settings
--------------------------

This tab contains the following settings / options :

- Trial Run : Don't remove anything from Clone ZIPs

  When this option is checked, then ROM Clone Zip Manager
  will just count files involved and estimate disk space 
  savings - but it will NOT actually delete anything from 
  any ZIP Files.

- Do the Actual Processing for real.  i.e. delete duplicates, etc.

  When this option is checked, then ROM Clone Zip Manager
  will count the files involved and calculate disk space 
  savings - AND it will also delete duplicate files from 
  inside Clone ZIP files.

  You will be prompted to confirm your decisions prior to any 
  processing taking place.
  
- Backup Files to be Deleted

  When this option is checked, then duplicate files will be 
  extracted from Clone ZIP files to the directory you specify 
  before they are deleted from the Clone ROM ZIP files.

If you are not doing a trial run, and you are backing up duplicate 
files, then a Confirmation dialog will be displayed before 
any "Clean Clone ZIPs" processing is performed.

If you are not doing a trial run, and you are NOT backing up 
duplicate files, then a Warning dialog will be displayed before 
any "Clean Clone ZIPs" processing is performed.


Using this Program - Pt 3:  Clean Clone ZIPs
--------------------------

On this tab, you need to select the directories to
process.  The easiest way to do this is to drag and 
drop your ROM directories on the "Rom Directories" listbox.
Alternatively, you can use the speed buttons provided
to add or remove directories, or reset the directory list.

When this is done, and you have set-up the "Originals / Clones"
list and the program settings on the "Setings" tab, then
you are ready to rock'n'roll.

Click the "Clean Clone ZIPs" button, and the directories,
Originals / Clones, Settings, etc will be verified.

If you are doing anything that will result in any files 
being changed (e.g. duplicates files to be deleted from 
Clone ZIP files), then you will be asked to Confirm 
your desire to perform the processing.

At the end of processing, a report will be generated
listing all duplicate files that were deleted and/or
backed up, and the disk space savings, time taken, etc
will be displayed.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Add in Error Checking and Validation.
  This program assumes - for the sake of performance - that :
    * all of your ZIP files are error free, 
    * there is enough harddisk space on your PC to ZIP, extract, 
      and re-ZIP files, 
    * your harddisk has no errors, 
    * etc, etc.

  i.e. This program currently does very little verification or 
  validation or error checking.

- Add support for Renamed ROM Sets - at the moment, you will need to 
  manually rename ROM sets - or use some other program - before you 
  can Generate Differences or Rebuild ZIPs.

- Display better progress information : estimated time, start 
  time, time remaining, etc during processing.

- Display the MAME 32 version number and details.

- Who knows, maybe even a Linux version (when I can get Delphi / Kylix 
  for Linux and actually get around to installing Linux on one of my PCs).

- Support for Command Line Parameters - so it can be run from the DOS
  command line (while Windows is running).

- This program does NOT generate CRCs - it simply uses the ones available 
  in the ZIP file's header information for each file in the ZIP file.
  This means that processing is much faster.  But could this cause problems ?
  Can the CRCs reported by the zip file be wrong ?  Are ZIP file CRCs -
  even those generated on other hardware and OS's - always 100% compatible 
  with WinZIP / MAME CRC's ?  (As far as I know, the answer to these 
  questions is No, No, and Yes - so there should be no problems here).

- Automatically  close the DOS Window after the Originals - Clones
  list has been built.  Although, I would prefer not to do this
  automatically - as this could override your own settings / desires.

  If the DOS Windows does not close automaticaly, then
  this means that the DOS MAME Executable does not have
  a "Close on Exit" option set.  If you want to set this option, 
  then right mouse click on the DOS MAME Executable from within 
  Windows Explorer, select "Properties" from the pop-up menu, 
  click on the "Program" tab, and check the "Close on Exit" option, 
  and then click the OK button.

  (I could make this program close the DOS window automatically, but I 
  would prefer to allow you to set this or not via the properties for the 
  DOS MAME Executable - see above - because then you can decide whether you 
  want to view any output after the DOS program(s) have been run or not).

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, or would like to give me some feedback on the program,
please email me and let me know.
