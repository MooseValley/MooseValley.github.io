Talking Clock Sounds		Copyright (C) Moose O'Malley, 
--------------------		April 1997.

The WAV files in this archive are for use with my 
Talking Clock program for Windows 3.1, 3.11, 95, NT.

The WAVs are recordings of my voice, which were 
painstakingly recorded and edited and re-edited 
using Windows Sound Recorder - all up I probably 
spent a full day or more on these samples !!

The original samples have since been tightened up, 
had the volume normalized, and downsampled to 22K 
16-bit .WAVs with no loss in quality -- and they 
ended up being less than half of the original size.  
(Thanks to Ted Tatman for his help on this !)

These sound files are Copyright (C) and cannot be 
edited or modified and no other use can be made of 
them without written prior permission from me.
