Words List Data File :  Interociter Word List 
----------------------  (109,582 words)

Words Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion
list of words called the Interociter Word List, 
which is a list of 109,582 words especially developed 
for use by Scrabble and Crossword players.  

This list seems even more reasonable than the 
Enable Word List (173,528 words) and contains words 
that you will find in any English dictionary.

This list is in the Public Domain.  (See below 
for further details).

This list of words is included with this Words 
Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion.  (But it 
is only used when the program is registered - see
"Limitations / Restrictions of the Shareware version"
in the program's text file).

Of course, I do not claim any rights over this word list.  
As such, it is distributed in unprotected, plain text form.
The word list is included completely free of charge 
with this program - but my program will not use this 
list or any other - until you register (i.e. purchase) 
my program.

Note that until you register (i.e. purchase the 
program), you will be limited to using a much shorter 
list of 938 words. 

To install this word list, simply unzip the contents of 
the ZIP file to the same directory as you installed 
Words Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion.

Downloaded the 4 word list ZIP files from SimTel and 
repacked the word lists into a single file.

                                                   Dallas, TX
                                                   6-Sep-91

This is a list of over 100,000 English words transcribed
orthographically. I obtained it from The Interociter bulletin
board in Dallas (214/258-1832). The original read.me file said
that the list came from Public Brand Software.

The original list contained 146,440 words, but I discovered that
there were thousands of duplicate words. I resorted the list and
removed the duplicates using the Unix utility uniq. The total
number of words is now 109,582. I have repackaged the list into
four files (the original was five):

     File         Bytes    Words   Range
     ---------    ------   -----   -----
     words1.lst   315376   29839   A-D
     words2.lst   242484   23101   E-K
     words3.lst   325716   30439   L-R
     words4.lst   270759   26203   S-Z
                  ----------------
     Total       1154335  109582

This word list includes inflected forms, such as plural nouns and
the -s, -ed and -ing forms of verbs. Thus the number of lexical stems
represented in the list is considerably smaller than the total
number of words.
