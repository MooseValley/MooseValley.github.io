Introduction :
--------------

Keyboard and Mouse Button Odometer for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, 
XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Keyboard and Mouse Button Odometer is a "for fun" program that 
simply keeps track of :
- how often you hit each key on the keyboard,
- how often you press the left, right, and middle mouse buttons.

When you run this program, it resides in the Windows Traybar
(in the tray area of where the clock, etc resides).

The program will silently monitor your keystokes and mouse 
clicks (even while minimised in the tray), and when you left mouse 
click on the program's icon in the tray bar (or right mouse click 
and choose the "Restore" option in the popup menu), then 
the program window will appear and show the latest totals 
for each keyboard key and mouse button.

You can click on the column headings : ASCII Value,
Key / Button Name, or Number of Key Presses and sort 
by the data in that particular column - either in 
ascending or descending order.

Further menu options enable you to :
- make the program stay "Always on Top" of other programs.
- Auto-Run the Program when Windows Starts Up.
- Restore Factory Defaults
- and all other functionality that is standard to my programs.
  (About menu, Catalog menu, etc).

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.
This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Limitations of this Program :
-----------------------------

This program is designed to run in the background and
monitor your keystrokes and mouse clicks.

As such, I have written this program so that it has as little
impact as possible on system resources : cpu, memory, etc.

In order to minimise the load on the system, it has been
necessary for me to trade-off and compromise absolute
accuracy.  That is, if you press keys extremely quickly, 
then there is a small chance that some key strokes may
not be counted.

The only alternative to this would be to use more system
resources to ensure that no keystrokes are missed.  But, 
this would then impct on other programs you are running,
and slow the system down.

If there is enough demand, I may release a version of this 
program where the user can select the Accuracy Vs System 
Resource Usage so that they can get superb accuracy for a 
higher impact on their system.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program.

If you would like any improvements, or would like to
suggest any improvements, please email me and let me know.

As with all of my shareware programs, how much more work I do on 
this program depends entirely on what support I get, how many 
people use the program, etc.

None of my programs are perfect - I am the first to admit that.
I have ideas for improvements and enhancements for all of my 
shareware.  How much I improve things and when depends on the 
support I receive for my hard work.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.

1.1  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings

                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
