Introduction :
--------------

Lottery Number $elector for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Lottery Number $elector is a program designed for the
sole purpose of helping you win loads of dosh on the lottery,
by helping you choose a nice random set of numbers for you 
to enter into your lottery - whatever the lottery's 
characteristics / rules !

To get a set of lottery numbers, simply change the settings 
to suit your particular lottery, and then press the 
"Generate Numbers" button and sit back and wait while
Lottery Number $elector graphically shuffles a random 
set of numbers for you.

You can also create / re-use lottery settings profiles, which 
contain how many numbers you can draw, the maximum number value, 
the number of supplementaries, etc for each particular lottery.
(See "Lottery Settings Profiles" below for further information).
 
Lottery Number $elector enables you to select :

- the number of balls you want to choose.
  The currently supported range is 1-16.

- the number of supplementary balls drawn.
  The currently supported range is 0-2.

- the total number of balls in the draw.
  The currently supported range is 20-999.  

Numbers drawn are shown inside circles and supplementary
numbers (if any) are shown inside squares.

With the wide range of settings provided, I believe that 
Lottery Number $elector will work with most if not all 
lotteries in the world.  However, if anybody needs 
anything extra, please let me know.

You can also set the ball colour and ball font size and colour.

This program could also be used to replace Bingo balls -
simply set the number of balls you want chosen to 1,
and set the total number of balls to whatever you need,
and press the "Generate Numbers" button to generate each 
seperate Bingo call.

Developed using 16-bit Delphi.


Lottery Settings Profiles :
---------------------------

You can also create / re-use lottery settings profiles, which 
contain how many numbers you can draw, the maximum number value, 
the number of supplementaries, etc for each particular lottery.

For example :

- Australian Powerball
  Choose 5 numbers from balls numbered 1-45
  marked on 1 numbered square grid,
  Plus a single supplementary "Power Ball" number
  which can be any number from 1 to 45 as well - marked on 
  a seperate numbered square grid.
  So, you could have numbers 3, 11, 22, 30, 38 and 22 as 
  the Powerball (i.e. the Powerball could be a repeat of
  one of the already chosen numbers).

So, Lottery Number $elector is quite flexible at defining the
parameters / rules for a Lottery.

If you need other special parameters / rules for your local 
lottery that are not supported by Lottery Number $elector, then
let me know and I will add them in.


The Future :
------------

Many things could be done with this program in the future,
such as :

- Log the numbers generated to a file, to enable users to
  look at previous draws.

- Enable graphs to be drawn on this previously drawn data
  to show which numbers are being generated most.
  (Over many 1,000's of draws, all numbers should be drawn
  fairly equally).

- Enable you to input the actual winning numbers of previous
  lottery draws, and use this data to alter the odds slightly
  to make the frequently occuring wining numbers more likely
  to be generated by this program.

- Enable the user to choose what random number seeds are used
  within the program to generate randow numbers.
  For example, your birth date, the time of the day, the current
  date, how many brothers / sisters you have, etc could all be 
  used as seeds to the random number generator !

- The ability to sort the drawn numbers into ascending order.

- Add in support for Greek Lottery, where you pick 5 numbers out 
  of 1 to 45 and 1 number out of 1 to 20.  i.e. there are two 
  pools in "Joker" instead of one.

- Anything else ?

What upgrades I do depends on what sort of response I get to 
this program, and what other suggestions I get.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.0     16-Jun-97   First Public Release.
1.1     11-Jan-98   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (2,888 lines of code.)

2.0   01-Feb-2001   Major Release !
                    Enable the saving, loading, and deleting of
                    the settings for various lotteries, so that
                    is is now simple to generate your lottery 
                    draw for a whole range of different lotteries.
                    Add in extra lottery settings rules / support.
                    Store the INI settings file in the program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    Fix an old bug in Borland Delphi / Windows NT
                    to fix NTDLL.DLL errors on closedown which 
                    occured on some Windows NT configurations.
                    Prevent form resizing / scaling.
                    (7,345 lines of code / comments.)

2.1  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (8,019 lines of code / comments.)

2.1b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (32,140 lines of code / comments.)

2.1f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.
