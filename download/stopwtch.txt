Introduction :
--------------

Stop Watch for Windows 95, 98, NT, ME, 2000, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

The Stop Watch remembers the Elapsed Time from the previous Stop
Watch session, so it can be used to accumulate time over many
days even if the computer is turned off in between.

Stop Watch is useful for :

- Monitoring how long you connect to the Internet, especially
  when you pay by the hour for usage, but you might not be billed
  until the end of the month.  Stop Watch let's you accumulate
  the total connection time for the month along with a detailed LOG.

- Benchmarking of various programs / applications under Windows.

- Benchmarking of various real world things outside your computer.

- One person (in England) is even using the program to time 
  motorcycles over 1/4 of a mile.  (To do this accurately, he 
  has hooked up a modified mouse to his PC that is triggered 
  by a beam of light being broken !!).

- Another guy in the San Francisco Bay area is using Stop Watch
  with it's various Snap Shot functions to time Yacht Races and 
  to actually time the turns and navigation of his own yacht 
  during races !!

- Timing groups of ocurences, such as runners or cars in a race
  (via the Snap Shot button - see below).

- Monitoring the amount of time your laptop battery has been 
  used / has left to go.

Stop Watch displays Elapsed time in 
- Seconds, 
- Minutes,
- Hours, and, 
- DD:HH:MM:SS.HH.

A "Snap Shot since last Resume / Start" button (the button with the 
smaller camera on it) enables Registered users to write the current 
elapsed times (since the last Resume or Start - whichever is the later)
to the log file without stopping the stop watch - great for timing 
multiple runners in a race crossing the finish line, etc.  This 
"Snap Shot" button is only enabled when the Stop Watch is actually 
running.

Snap Shot events are written to the log file like this :
   >> Snap Shot 001 Time since Resume/Start :       00.00:00:00.92    00.00:00:00.92
   >> Snap Shot 002 Time since Resume/Start :       00.00:00:02.03    00.00:00:02.03

Where the Elapsed times line up under the headings already
found in the log file.

Also, a "Snap Shot since original Start" button (the button with the 
larger camera on it) enables Registered users to write the current 
elapsed times (since the original Start) to the log file without 
stopping the stop watch - great for timing multiple runners in a 
race crossing the finish line, etc.  This "Snap Shot" button is 
enabled when the Stop Watch is running and when the Stop Watch 
is paused.

Snap Shot events are written to the log file like this :
   >> Time since original start :                   00.00:00:14.00

In this example, the Stop Watch elapsed time might only be 3 seconds, 
but the time since original start would be 14.00 seconds if the 
Stop Watch was paused for 11 seconds.

Stop Watch is set to be swapped-in by Windows every 1,000 of a second,
but how often the Stop Watch is swapped-in depends on your PC, and
on what else you are running.  How often Stop Watch is swapped-in
determines how often the Elapsed Time details are updated each 
second.

The Elapsed time in DD:HH:MM:SS.HH output area is selectable by the
user, so you can PAUSE the Stop Watch, select the current value of the
elapsed time, and copy it to the ClipBoard  or any other application.

Stop Watch uses a local settings (INI) file, which lives in the 
directory wherever Stop Watch was loaded from.  This enables
you to run multiple distinct Stop Watch sessions at the one time
by having copies of Stop Watch each in their own directory.

Stop Watch can also keep and log the number of times you press
the Stop button, which enables you to count the number of phone
calls you have made to your ISP or work model pool, and helps
add up expenses and costs.  I use this feature a lot !

Developed using Borland Delphi.


Using multiple PC's :
---------------------

To enable users to easily run Stopwatch on multiple PC's
and synchronise their current Stopwatch times and LOG details,
use the menu options "Copy Stopwatch Times To Floppy Disk A:" 
and "Copy Stopwatch Times From Floppy Disk A:".

"Copy Stopwatch Times To Floppy Disk A:" :
- saves all current Stopwatch times / settings to the stopwtch.INI
  file.
- copies this INI file to the A:\ drive.
- Copies the current Stopwatch LOG file to the A:\ drive.

"Copy Stopwatch Times From Floppy Disk A:" :
- copies the stopwtch.INI file from the A:\ drive to the 
  directory where Stopwatch is being run from.
- Reloads all Stopwatch times / settings from this stopwtch.INI
  file.
- Copies the current Stopwatch LOG file from the A:\ drive to the 
  directory where Stopwatch is being run from.

These menu options are available to Registered Users only !

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.1   19-Sep-1996   First Public Release.
1.2   18-Oct-1996   Add in Day of Week and Date display in main window.
1.3   01-Nov-1996   Add in display hundreths of seconds.  Change philosophy
                    of timer functionality to use milli-seconds since mid-night
                    instead of relying on windows to swap-in the timer when
                    requested / required.  User can now copy Elapsed Time 
                    (DD:HH:MM:SS.HH) to the Clipboard.
1.4   09-Jan-1997   Imrpove accuracy of Stop Watch.  Enable detailed 
                    logging of elapsed and cummulative times to a user 
                    selected Log File.  Also add in Log File Select button.
                    Remove the Moose picture from the main screen.
1.5   27-Jan-1997   Add in Registration functionality.
1.6   20-Mar-1997   Add in loads of Tooltips to fields and buttons.
                    Rearrange labels slightly to enable me to make 
                    application window smaller.
1.7   07-Apr-1997   Add in a "Snap Shot" button that enables you
                    to write the current elapsed times to the log
                    file without stopping the stop watch - great
                    for timing multiple runners in a race crossing 
                    the finish line, etc.  (Registered Vers only)
                    (These changes were requested by Carter West)
1.8   22-Apr-1997   Add in the ability to Log the Time since the
                    start button was originally pressed.
                    (This change was requested by Carter West)
                    Stop Watch now uses a local settings (INI) file, 
                    which lives in the directory wherever Stop 
                    Watch was loaded from.
                    Also make various small improvements.  e.g.
                    improve format of the log file, simplify logging
                    code / strategy, etc.
1.9   03-May-1997   Make the "Log Time since Original Start" menu
                    option a button instead, with a large camera on it.
                    Make the normal Snap Shot button a button
                    with a smaller camera on it.
1.95  16-Jun-1997   Save settings automatically on Windows 95 shutdown 
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Start Minimised if set in Shortcut / settings
                    (Registered Users only).  
                    Improve application startup - size and position 
                    form before user sees it.
                    Add in Menu items for viewing my Shareware Catalog, 
                    the Readme file, and the Registration Form.
2.0   11-Jan-1998   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    Improve initial display of StopWatch, and get it 
                    to correctly handle last used window poisition 
                    parameter values.
                    (3,593 lines of code / comments.)
2.1   24-Jun-1998   Enable people to run this program on multiple 
                    PC's and synchronise their stopwatch times and 
                    log details accross multiple PC's by adding in :
                    "Copy Stopwatch Times To Floppy Disk A:" and
                    "Copy Stopwatch Times From Floppy Disk A:"
                    menu options.  (Specially for Nancy S !)
                    (3,986 lines of code / comments.)
2.2   02-Dec-1998   Add in EXPERT mode, which means that the
                    user will not receive confirmation that the 
                    Log file or Stopwatch has been reset.
                    Expert Mode is available under the "File" Menu.  
                    (Registered Users only).
                    (Specially for Ray Chesin !)
                    (4,123 lines of code / comments.)
2.3   28-Jul-1999   Add in functionality to enable only the time
                    with no other labels to be written to the Log
                    file.  This was done specially for ???
                    who is using Stop Watch to time bicycle race
                    Events, and wanted to be able to Copy & Paste
                    all the times for all riders easily into a 
                    spreadsheet.
                    (4,316 lines of code / comments.)

3.0   18-Apr-2000   Save Settings to the INI file whenever the STOP button is
                    pressed.  This is to prevent loss of stop watch times
                    if system crash, power outtage, etc occurs.
                    (Specially for Peter Guhl !)
                    Enhance "About ..." window with buttons to
                    copy my email and WEB page address to the
                    Window's clipboard, so user can simply
                    paste them into WEB Browser or Email program.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's 
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    Add in "Always On Top" functionality - available 
                    from the "File" menu.  (Added especially for 
                    my good friend Patrick Cullinan !)
                    (6,297 lines of code / comments.)

3.1   26-Mar-2001   Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (8,604 lines of code / comments.)

3.2   20-Nov-2002   Add in Exit button.
                    Improve the interface - bitmaps on buttons, etc.
                    Add in the ability to write the number of times the STOP 
                    button has been pressed.  (Great for adding up phone bills, etc - 
                    if you use Stop Watch with your modem for work, etc - which I do
                    a great deal).
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (34,513 lines of code / comments.)

3.3   29-Aug-2003   Fix the day of the week - it was showing a day ahead.
                    (I'm amazed that I hadn't noticed this issue before,
                    and that no-one had reported the problem ... )
                    Remove short file name restrictions, so that long 
                    log-file names are OK.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (60,111 lines of code / comments.)

3.3f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.


If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is most likely an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my Home page and its mirrors.
