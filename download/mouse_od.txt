Introduction :
--------------

Mouse Odometer is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, 
netbooks, etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which 
includes Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Mouse Odometer is a "for fun" program that simply keeps track of :
- Your mouse cursor movement and converts this to a total 
  distance travelled in Kilometers by the mouse cursor, based on 
  the screen resolution and size of your current display.
- And the number of left and right mouse clicks.

At the moment, the mouse movement is monitored 20 times per second.

In Mouse Odometer's Settings Screen, you can enter your viewable 
screen width and viewable screen height to make the distance 
calculations as accurate as possible.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Using Mouse Odometer :
----------------------

To use Mouse Odometer, simply run the program and then let it do
it's mouse monitoring and measuring.

When Mouse Odometer is run, it is auto-minimised to the Windows TrayBar 
(with the clock, etc) on start-up and whenever the program is minimised.  
The icon for Mouse Odometer in Windows TrayBar is the "mouse with red legs 
and black shoes".  Double click on this icon to open Mouse Odometer's window, or 
right-mouse click on the icon and select a menu option from the pop-up menu.
                    
The program keeps monitoring mouse movement and counting mouse clicks 
even when it is minimised or iconised.

Use the settings screen to enter your viewable screen size in 
centimeters, which is used in converting pixels to Kilometers 
when calculating the movement distance.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Enable the user to specify how often to check for mouse movement.
  At the moment, the mouse movement is monitored 5 times per second.

- Improved accuracy - does anyone need their mouse monitored more 
  than 20 times per second ?

- Add in forecasting to estimate how far the mouse will move in a year
  at the current movement rates.

- Add in averages for the Km or Miles moved per hour since monitoring
  was first started.

- Monitoring on middle (3rd) mouse button clicks.

- Mouse wheel movement monitoring.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

As with all of my shareware programs, how much more work I do on 
this program depends entirely on what support I get, how many 
people use the program, etc.

None of my programs are perfect - I am the first to admit that.
I have ideas for improvements and enhancements for all of my 
shareware.  How much I improve things and when depends on the 
support I receive for my hard work.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0   14-Apr-2000   First Public Release.
                    (5,285 lines of code / comments.)

1.1   10-Jan-2001   Make the Font bigger.  Improve the display.
                    Add in Left and Right Mouse Click counting.

                    Add in "Always On Top" menu option / functionality.
                    (7,180 lines of code / comments.)

1.2  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    Thousands seperator in the mouse clicks (its amazing how 
                    quickly you click a mouse button a few thousand times !!).
                    (8,168 lines of code / comments.)

1.3  13-Oct-2001    Add in a comma seperated on the number of mouse clicks.
                    Add in support for *huge* numbers.  The program now handles
                    up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (~2^63) mouse button 
                    clicks - yep, that's 9.2 Exa clicks folks !! - and up to
                    10^308 kilometers travelled (the diameter of the entire
                    Milky Way galaxy is only 10^17 kilometers) - so, these 
                    huge numbers should hopefully be enough for everyone ... ;))
                    After a year of using this program, I am already up to
                    200,000+ mouse clicks, so at this rate, this program should 
                    be useful for more than 650 billion lifetimes of mouse 
                    measuring before the numbers start at zero again !!



                    If any immortals feel that these numbers are still too 
                    limited, let me know !!  ;))
                    Add in "Restore Factory Defaults" menu option.
                    Brand New About Screen and associated functionality.
                    Add in support for the Maximise icon in the top right 
                    corner of the program's main window.
                    Enable the program to live on the Windows 95, 98, NT, 
                    2000, etc tray bar.
                    (8,997 lines of code / comments.)

1.4  07-Nov-2001    Output distance travelled correct to 8 decimal places
                    which is the resolution of my current measurements.
                    (The previous 10 decimal places were overkill).
                    Add in support for Metric (centimeters, kilometers)
                    and Imperial (inches, miles) units of measure.
                    (9,738 lines of code / comments.)

1.4b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (30,256 lines of code / comments.)

1.5   07-Mar-2003   Remove the Tray Icon functionality, which was 
                    clashing with the ability to run the program 
                    minimised, normal, or maximised on startup.
                    (Thanks to Thomas B for reporting this problem).
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code 
                    libraries.
                    (46,659 lines of code / comments.)

1.6   30-June-2003  Add in support for all of the various Windows
                    Regional Settings for floating point numbers. 
                    i.e. Allow people to use something other than a 
                    full stop as the decimal point, and something 
                    other than a comma as a 1,000's separator.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code 
                    libraries.
                    (46,848 lines of code / comments.)

1.6f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.

1.7f  2-Mar-2015    Auto-minimise Mouse Odometer to Windows TrayBar (with the clock, etc)
                    on start-up and whenever the program is minimised.  The icon for 
                    Mouse Odometer in Windows TrayBar is the "mouse with red legs and black shoes".  
                    Just double click on this icon to open Mouse Odometer's window, or 
                    right-mouse click on the icon and select a menu option from the pop-up menu.
                    Greetings to "Morc" who requested this TrayBar functionality earlier today.
                    Add exception handling to the loading and saving of program settings (INI file)
                    so that the program executes and exits cleanly (no error messages produced) even 
                    if running from a read-only device such as a optical disk (CD-ROM, etc) or 
                    there are disk errors or the disk is full and/or the INI file does not exist 
                    and/or it cannot be created.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (770 lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (32,435 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all primary, library, and include files.)
