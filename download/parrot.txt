Introduction :
--------------

Parrot Trainer for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Parrot Trainer is a utility to help you train your bird(s) 
or kids (!!) to talk.

Also use it to nag your kids, husband, wife, etc.  ;)

Simply record a sound file using Windows Sound Recorder,
and then select this file in Parrot Trainer, specify the
interval between replays, and hit the "Play Sound" button,
and Parrot Trainer will repeat the sound file over and over
again until you tell it to stop.

Parrot Trainer displays these statistics :
- the number of seconds since the sound file was last played, 
- the number of times the sound file has been played,
- the number of minutes the sound file has been playing.

You can modify the sound file being played and the Interval 
between re-Plays all on the fly.

Parrot Trainer also allows you to replay the sound forever,
replay the sound for a specified number of minutes,
or replay the sound a specified number of times.

You can also modify the sound replay method and values on the fly.

With the interval between re-plays set to 1 or 0, you can get 
some really interesting RAP like results, which should really 
fry your poor bird's brain !!


A Parrot Joke :    (Courtesy of John "Lord of Darkness" Biddiscombe)
---------------

Bloke goes into Pet shop....

Bloke:
  "I'd like to buy a parrot". Seeing three he says, "Oooh that 
  red one looks nice, how much is it ?".

Pet Shop owner:
  Pet shop bloke says, "I'm afraid that one's £2000 sir.  A very 
  expensive parrot".

Bloke:
  "Good lord why, what can make it so expensive ?".

Pet Shop owner:
  "Well, it can do the entire Ring cycle by Wagner, very parrot-like 
  rendition, but extremely good, and the finest Parrot Wagner 
  you'll ever hear."

Bloke:
  "Ah I see ....  How about the yellow one ?"

Pet Shop owner:
  "I'm afraid you're looking at £5000 for that one, Schubert sir, 
  Concertos, symphonies, hums the tunes like you'd never believe, 
  fantastic sound.  Well worth £5000 !"

Bloke:
  "And how about the blue one then, any chance of finding a normal 
  household parrot there ?"

Pet shop owner:
  "I'm afraid not sir, that one's £10,000"

Bloke:
  "Be serious man !  What on earth can make it worth £10,000 ?"

Pet shop owner:
  "Well I'm afraid I can't tell you sir, we only got that parrot 
  yesterday, and I've not heard him sing yet, but what I can 
  tell you is that the other two call him 'Maestro' !!"

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.1     08-Dec-96   First Public Release.
1.2     01-Jan-97   Enable users to run Sound Recorder to record a 
                    sound file.  Add in ability to replay sound forever,
                    or for a specified number of minutes, or for a
                    specified number of times.
1.3     04-Jan-97   When you double click on the sound file box, the
                    File Selection dialog pops up now.
                    Also add in Sound Select and Sound Record buttons.
1.4     27-Jan-97   Add in Registration functionality.
1.5     15-Jun-97   Save settings automatically on Windows 95 shutdown 
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Start Minimised if set in Shortcut / settings
                    (Registered Users only).  
                    Improve application startup - size and position 
                    form before user sees it.
                    Add in Menu items for viewing my Shareware Catalog, 
                    the Readme file, and the Registration Form.
1.6     11-Jan-98   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (2,911 lines of code.)

1.7   01-Feb-2001   Store the INI settings file in the program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    Fix an old bug in Borland Delphi / Windows NT
                    to fix NTDLL.DLL errors on closedown which 
                    occured on some Windows NT configurations.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's 
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    (6,851 lines of code / comments.)

1.8  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (7,486 lines of code / comments.)

1.8b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (31,518 lines of code / comments.)
