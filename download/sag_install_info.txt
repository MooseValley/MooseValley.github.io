Overhead Cable Sag Calculator

This program calculates the sag of static overhead cables 
of uniform self-weight.  e.g. electric transmission lines.

Until you purchase the program (and obtain Registration 
codes that unlock the full functionality of the program), 
you will NOT be able to :
(1) Save any data to disk, or,
(2) Print or Copy the report.

Registering the program removes these restrictions.

Pricing details, a Registration Form, and further help 
is available on the WEB page and/or included with the 
program's on-line help.

This program is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, 
and Windows Vista, and Windows 7.
