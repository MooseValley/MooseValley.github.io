Introduction :

MAME32 Screen Shot Organizer for Windows 95, 98, NT, ME, 2000, XP, 
and similar operating systems.

MAME32 Screen Shot Organizer is a companion utility / tool for the 
MAME 32 Arcade Machine Emulator :

	http://www.mame.net

MAME32 Screen Shot Organizer simply enables you to view and drag 
& drop (with the mouse) screen shots so that you can arrange your 
screen shots for each parent game and its clones with ease.

This could be useful for anyone who wants to arrange their screen
shots in a certain way.  e.g. show the title screen for each 
parent game of each set, and then show various screen shots of 
each game in action for the clones.

To enable this functionality, you need to :

 1. Specify the snap shots directory.  i.e. the directory where 
    your MAME Screen Shots reside as PNG files.  
    These screen shots cannot be inside a ZIP file(s).
    i.e. they need to exist as separate PNG files in the 
    above directory.

 2. Specify the directory path and name of the DOS or Windows 
    Command Line version of MAME.

 3. Press the "Refresh Originals / Clones List" button.   

Once you do these three things, then you are ready to view and 
drag & drop the screen shots so you can reorganise the screen 
shots for each parent game and its clones as desired.

Without this program, you would need to manually rename files
using Windows Explorer or by typing commands at the DOS Command 
prompt.  Both very slow and tedious ways to rename bunches of 
files.

This program makes it exceptionally easy to reorganise the 
screen shots for each game.

I hope you find this program useful.

MAME32 Screen Shot Organizer is NOT an official part of the 
MAME project.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.


Why I wrote this Program / Why use this Program :
-------------------------------------------------

I wrote this program so that I could reorganise all of 
my MAME screen shots.

I decided that I wanted to have the title screen for each game
as the screen shot for each parent game, and then various 
screen shots in the order I liked best for each clone.

After renaming some files manually using Windows Explorer,
I soon grew very tired of that approach, so - as I usually do - 
I sat down and wrote this program.

And, soon I had all of my screen shots organised as required.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply unzip it to a directory (using 
PKUNIP, WinZIP, or similar), run it, and click on the buttons to
view / perform the activities you require.

You can Drag & Drop a file or a directory onto this program 
using Windows Explorer.

Before you can use this program, you need to :

 1. Specify the snap shots directory.  i.e. the directory where 
    your MAME Screen Shots reside as PNG files.  
    These screen shots cannot be inside a ZIP file(s).
    i.e. they need to exist as separate PNG files in the 
    above directory.

 2. Specify the directory path and name of the DOS or Windows 
    Command Line version of MAME.

 3. Press the "Refresh Originals / Clones List" button.   

Once you do these three things, then you are ready to view and 
drag & drop the screen shots so you can reorganise the screen 
shots for each parent game and its clones as desired.

Simply, click on the parent game, and any screen shots for 
it and its clones will be displayed.  Reorganising the screen
shots is as simple as dragging and dropping them with your 
mouse.


Limitations / Restrictions of the program :
-------------------------------------------

None.  There is no trial period and there is no "cutdown"
or "restricted" functionality that requires users to register.

This program is FREE software - any person and any company is
welcome to copy it, use it, and distribute it as they see fit,
as long as the EXEcutable and this text file remain intact.

If you paid money for this program, then you were ripped off,
and you should complain to the person who sold it to you !!
(Don't complain to me, it's nothing to do with me !!).


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Add a right-mouse click Popup Menu to enable you to :
   * Delete a screen shot, or,
   * Execute MAME so that you can redo a screen shot.

- A version with US spelling, such as "organizer" instead of 
  the standard English "organiser" !!  ;)

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, or would like to give me some feedback on the 
program, please email me and let me know.
