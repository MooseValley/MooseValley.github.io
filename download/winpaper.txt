Introduction :
--------------

Windows Wallpaper Changer for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, 
XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Windows Wallpaper Changer randomly selects a Bitmap file and 
makes this the new Windows' Wallpaper (i.e. the picture you 
see behind the icons on your Main Windows Desktop).  

The user can specify directory from which Bitmaps are 
randomly chosen, and the interval (in Seconds) in which the
Windows Wallpaper is changed to the new bitmap.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Windows Wallpaper Changer will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP
file to a directory - such as c:\winpaper - and run
the executable file winpaper.EXE.

Then, choose the directory where your desktop bitmaps
reside - these may be scanned photos of your friends,
family, or pets, or be photos you have grabbed
from the internet.

Then, set the interval (in seconds) between
Wallpaper changes, and the program will automaticaly
change the Windows Wallpaper for you at these times.

You may also want to make this program load minimised
each time Windows Starts Up.

To achieve this, create a shortcut to the winpaper.EXE
and place it in the Windows StartUp folder and alter
the properties of this shortcut to "Run Minimised".


Bitmaps (.BMP) Files Only :
---------------------------

This program only works with Bitmaps (.BMP) files, as these
are the files that Windows needs to set as Wallpaper.
If your graphics files are in another format (Jpeg, GIF,
etc) then you will need to convert these to BMP files.

To achieve this, I recommend using Paint Shop Pro, 
which is available on various PC magaine cover CD's
or from the internet at : http://www.jasc.com


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Full support for the Maximise icon.  (Only partial support 
  is provided at the moment).

- Support for other graphic formats.  e.g. JPG, GIF, etc.

- Ability to exit (or stop) after X changes of the wall paper.

- Ability randonly change wall paper to any file except what 
  is currently set as the wall paper.  That is, force the wall 
  paper to change - do NOT allow the wall paper that is 
  currently set to be re-used.

- Anything else ?

If you would like these improvements, or would like to
suggest something else, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0   25-Nov-1998   First Public Release.
                    (4,464 lines of code / comments.)
                    
1.1   25-Nov-2001   Store the INI settings file in the program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    Add Restore Factory Defaults, Always on Top, and 
                    Auto-Run at Windows Startup options to the File menu.
                    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts".
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Brand New About Screen and associated functionality.
                    Add in *partial* support for the Maximise icon in the 
                    top right corner of the program's main window.
                    Make the program reside in the Windows Tray Bar
                    with the clock, etc.
                    This program is now for 32 bit Windows or later.  
                    e.g. Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, or later.
                    i.e. Windows 3.x is no longer supported.
                    (9,840 lines of code / comments).

1.2    6-Jan-2002   Add a "Change Now" button to change the wallpaper
                    to the next random wallpaper available.
                    Add in the number of seconds remaining until the 
                    next wallpaper change.
                    You can now type in the directory / path directly - 
                    without having to select it.
                    Double mouse clicking on the directory entry box
                    runs the "Directory Select" functionality.  i.e.
                    it is the same as clicking the button to the left of 
                    the directory entry box.
                    Add in additional options - stretching pictures to fit 
                    the screen, tiling pictures, and centering pictures.
                    (10,225 lines of code / comments).

1.2b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (33,305 lines of code / comments.)

1.2f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.


If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is possibly an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my WEB page - see below.
