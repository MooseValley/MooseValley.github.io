Introduction :
--------------

This prototype game is simply to allow me to develop and test 
my prototype sprite engine.

This prototype game is not polished or even fully playable, and 
is severely lacking in many areas : 
* the sound is abysmal, 
* the control system is limited to the keyboard, 
* the code is largely unoptimised, 
* the game is barely playable,
* the sprites are low quality and each only has a few frames of animation,
* the background is a simple single scrolling bitmap,
* the collision detection is not satisfactory
* etc

However, it serves as a basis upon which I can further develop my 
game and sprite engines.

Because the code is mostly unoptimised, the game currently requires 
a reasonably fast PC to get the full 40 frames per second.  
i.e. a Pentium III 500 MHz or above is perfect.

However, even though it is still early days, things are looking 
promising, and some features of my Prototype Sprite Engine include :
* (Almost) Flicker free animation for any number of sprites on screen 
  at once, each with their own number of frames of animation, 
  sizes / resolutions, number of colours, own movement agendas, 
  speeds, scores, hit points, etc.
* Linking of sprite states to sounds, so that sounds can play when 
  sprites are created, destroyed, etc.
* Written in very easily understandable and maintainable Delphi 
  code - using simple BitBlitting of images - no Direct/X at this stage.
* Eight way Scrolling background bitmap images.

I wrote this prototype game / sprite engine "for fun" way back in 
early-mid 2000.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program is for Windows 95 / 98 / ME / NT / 2000 / XP / 
and similar.


Installing this Program :
-------------------------

Run the GAME_INSTALLER.EXE in the distribution ZIP file, and 
follow the prompts - just like many other standard Windows 
programs.

To run the program you could :

1. Navigate your Start menu and look for the 
   "Moose's Software" group and run the game, or,

2. Locate the place where you installed the program 
   (using Windows Explorer) - the default location
   is c:\Program Files\Game\, and double click on the 
   game's executable to run it,

just like many other standard Windows programs.


Uninstalling this Program :
----------------------------

Use the Add / Remove programs in Windows Control Panel to uninstall this 
program - just like many other standard Windows programs.


The Future :
--------------

* Optimisation !
* Better sound - may mean moving to Direct/X - darn it !!!
* A better prototype game (to demonstrate the sprite engine),
* More behind the scenes options, so my sprite engine will 
  natively support space invaders type games, platform games, 
  simple 2D driving / flying / running games, etc,
* Enemies that attack back.
* Physics engine,
* Parallax scrolling,
* Multiple levels of background / scenery,
* Tile mapping (to enable scrolling backgrounds to be built),
* Accurate collision detection
* Better graphics.  e.g. high-resolution sprites each with dozens or 
  hundreds of frames of animation.
* etc.

Thanks / credits go to :

- Ari Feldman for his great Sprites (Graphics images)

- ZOIDS Music : in MIDI format

  Originally from the wierd Commodore 64 game of the same name.

  This music was composed for the C=64 game by the legendary 
  Rob Hubbard (and he based the music on Synergy's Ancestors 
  music from their great "Audion" album).

  A MIDI version was created for the PC by :
  Chris Abbott (HiTec Music, HTML@aol.com) and 
  Rochus Wessels (rochus@math.uni-muenster.de)

- The Sound effects (WAV files) have been on my harddrive so long 
  that I have forgotten where they came from originally.
  They could be from a Zillion Sounds CD or some other program.

- The background (the plate of pasta) is an old Windows desktop 
  bitmap that was downloaded from somewhere on the internet many 
  years ago.

Vers    Date        Description

0.05  5-Sep-2002    First Public Release (but program was written ~2 years ago).
                    (4,584 lines of code / comments.)

If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is most likely an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my Home page and its mirrors.
