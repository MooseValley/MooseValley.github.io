Introduction :
--------------

Clipboard Tools is for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Clipboard Tools enables you to :
- Erase the data on the Window's Clipboard,
- View the Text or Bitmap data in the Window's Clipboard,
- List the formats of data currently available in the Window's 
  Clipboard

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Clipboard Tools is for Windows 95 / 98 / NT / 2000.
This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply unzip it to a directory and run it,
and then click the buttons to perform the functionality
listed above.

If you want this program to be "Always On Top" 
of other Windows, then select the "Always On Top"
menu option under the "File" menu.


Why is this useful ?  /  Why do this ?
--------------------------------------

I often work with DOS or Console applications, and these can 
be very twitchy.  e.g. you can select the text and copy it 
from any DOS character based application, but this doesn't 
always work - especially when the clipboard already 
contails data.

So, I originally wrote this program with the single "Erase
Clipboard" button to overcome this limitation / bug
in the Windows Clipboard - DOS / Console application
interface.

It has since been extended to provide other functionality
that can be useful from time to time.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :
- Enable the display of more formats of Clipboard data - such as
  Rich Text, sound, etc data.
- Buttons to contain the last 5 or 10 items contained in the 
  Windows clipboard - to enable you to re-use and re-copy this
  old data into your documents, etc.
- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.
