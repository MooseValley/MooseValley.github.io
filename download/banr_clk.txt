Timed WEB URL / Banner Visitor  - v1.1           >> Mick the Clicker <<
****************************************

This program visits a list of nominated WEB URLs every hour or so.

These URLs can be banner sites, sponsor sites, or your own site(s)
to increase your clicks.

I wrote this program because less than 1 in 5,000 people visiting
my WEB site bothered to click on my Ad banners.

Others may find it useful to increase click revenue as well !!  ;)

N.B. There is no point in a single person visiting your banner / sponsor 
     more than once per hour - if you do then all clicks in that hour count 
     as one click only !!!

This program is FREEWARE - please copy it, give it to your friends,
put in on CDs, stick it on WEB and FTP sites, and use it all you want !!

This program is for Windows 95, 98, NT, or 2000.

The program will work best on PCs with a permanent internet connection,
so that the "clicking" can occur 24 hours a day.  If not, you will have 
to run this program when you log onto the net and exit the program 
when you log-off again.

When run, this program lives in the Windows Tray Bar - with the clock, etc.
(It's icon is a memory chip !!).

Left Mouse click on the icon to activate it, type in the WEB URL's
(Banners, sponsors, etc) you want to visit, set the time options,
and minimise it and forget it while it does its job !!

You can even stick a shortcut to the program in your StartUp group.

Releases :
1.1  10-Mar-2000    First Public Release.

Enjoy !
