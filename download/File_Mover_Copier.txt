Introduction :
--------------

File Mover / Copier is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 
2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

File Mover / Copier is a program to help you move or 
copy files from one or more directories (and, if you 
desire, all of the sub-directories in these directories) 
to a single target directory.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
--------------------------------------------

I wrote this program because Susan V completed the 
Program Suggestion Form on my web site requesting this 
program.  Susan was moving files from many dozens of 
directories and their sub-directories to a single directory 
on a regular basis and it was taking her hours of mouse 
clicking and manual file renaming to do this.

Susan received a free complimentary registered version 
of this program for thinking up the idea for this program.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\File_Mover\ - and run the executable 
file : File_Mover.EXE.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

When the program is running, you can use the buttons provided 
to select a target directory, and add or remove items
from the list of source directories.

In addition, you can simply drag and drop files from Windows 
Explorer.

You can then chose whether to copy files or move files.

Finally, you can choose whether to transfer files from just 
the selected directories, or the selected directories and 
all of their sub-directories.

When you have everything set as you desire, then you can
click the "Transfer Files" button.

If you desire, you can keep and view a log file of the 
latest processing (to the file "File_Mover_Copier_Log.txt" 
in the directory where the program is installed.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete Solar System Simulator  
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Before doing this however :

- If you have selected / enabled the "Auto-Run at Windows 
  Startup" option (under the File menu), then you should 
  ensure that this option is not checked / enabled 
  (which you can easily do by re-selecting the 
  "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" option from under 
  the File menu).

- If you have used any of the "Create Shortcut ..." options 
  under the File menu, then you should use the "Delete All 
  Shortcuts" option under the File menu to remove these from
  your system.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- At the moment, the program generates a unique file name by 
  appending a number in brackets to the file name if a file with 
  the same name already exists.  Further options could be added 
  in the future to allow you to overwrite or ignore files with 
  duplicate names.  In addition, files with the same name could 
  be compared and only assigned a unique name and transferred if 
  they are different to the files already there.

- Add in the ability to choose your own log file's name, and/or 
  append processing results to existing log files.

- Ability to specify which file types to process.
  e.g. you might like to process pictures only (i.e. GIF, BMP, 
  JPG, etc files), or you may only want to process documents 
  (i.e. txt, DOC, RTF, PDF, etc files).

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.
