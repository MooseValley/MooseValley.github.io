Introduction :
--------------

Calendar Year Simple is a very basic program for Windows 
95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

Calendar Year Simple shows a very simple full year 
calendar for whatever year you select - and that's 
about it.

This program is freeware - please distribute it and 
use it freely.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
--------------------------

I wrote this program because I always seem to need 
a full year calendar so I can look at things a
whole year at a time.

So, as I usually do, I developed this program, and it
has proven so useful to me that I am releasing it
as freeware onto my web page.


Credits / Thanks :
------------------

Nil.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\calendar\ - and run the executable 
file : Calendar_Year_Simple.EXE.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu 
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete Mad Cow Disease 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Before doing this however :

- If you have selected / enabled the "Auto-Run at Windows 
  Startup" option (under the File menu), then you should 
  ensure that this option is not checked / enabled 
  (which you can easily do by re-selecting the 
  "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" option from under 
  the File menu).

- If you have used any of the "Create Shortcut ..." options 
  under the File menu, then you should use the "Delete All 
  Shortcuts" option under the File menu to remove these from
  your system.

Simple as that !


Limitations / Restrictions of the program :
-------------------------------------------

None.  There is no trial period and there is no "cutdown"
or "restricted" functionality that requires users to register.

This program is FREE software - any person and any company is
welcome to copy it, use it, and distribute it as they see fit,
as long as the EXEcutable and this text file remain intact.

If you paid money for this program, then you were ripped off,
and you should complain to the person who sold it to you !!
(Don't complain to me, it's nothing to do with me !!).


The Future :
------------

No plans at this stage - what more is there to do ??


Warranty :
----------

This software and the accompanying files are provided "as is" and
without warranties as to performance or merchantability or any
other warranties whether expressed or implied.

The user assumes the entire risk of using this software.

If you do find any faults with this program, email me and let 
me know, and I will do my best to fix it ASAP.
