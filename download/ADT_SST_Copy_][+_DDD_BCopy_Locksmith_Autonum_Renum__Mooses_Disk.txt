26-May-2005: v1.0 First Release.
21-Jan-2011: v1.1 Updated "Transferring Copy Protected Disks : PC -> Apple 2"


****************************************************
Apple 2 Disk Image Contents
****************************************************

Here are the contents of the disk that I use to do my transfers :

- SST - Super Saltines Transcopy

- ADT : Apple <-> PC Disk Transfer

- Copy ][+ v5.0

- DDD - Daltons Disk Disintegrator v2.0

- Trackstar 128 File transfer (Only useful if you have an Apple 2 
disk drive hooked up to a Trackstar 128 Expansion Card in your PC.  
i.e. this program is useless for )

- BCOPY v1.5

- Locksmith v4.1

- RENUMBER

- DOS BOSS

For disk transfer purposes, SST - Super Saltines Transcopy and ADT : 
Apple <-> PC Disk Transfer are the two programs you need on the Apple 
2 computer.


****************************************************
 Apple <-> PC Disk Transfers
****************************************************

The version of ADT on this floppy disk image is ADT v1.21 - so it may 
or may not work with other versions of ADT or ADT for Windows.

ADT is the "Apple Disk Transfer" utility.  Paul Guertin developed ADT 
as a way to transfer 5.25" disk image files from PC directly to 
diskette on a 64k or larger Apple II and to send 5.25" diskettes to 
PC where they are saved as .DSK disk image files.  

A typical ADT setup is an Apple II with a serial card or built-in 
serial port connected via a NULL modem cable to a PC's COM port with 
each computer running ADT.

ADT can only handle standard Apple ][ floppy disks.  i.e. non copy 
protected disks and disks that don't have strange formats.  If you 
have these types of disks, then you need to use SST - Super Saltines 
Transcopy.  See "Transferring Copy Protected Disks" below for further 
details.

There are various versions of ADT - DOS or Windows - depending on 
which OS you like.

To install ADT on your Apple ][, you type in a command on your Apple 
][ (usually IN#2 or similar, see Rubywand's excellent Csa2 FAQs) and 
hit the send button on the PC (which is running ADT as well), and the 
PC will send the Apple version down the null modem wire to the Apple 
][ - it really is amazing software.

Then, you can save ADT to a disk on the Apple ][ and BRUN it, and 
then you can transfer over the disk image I sent you and then you 
should then be able to transfer standard and copy protected disks 
using the software it contains.  E.g. SST.

For more information about all aspects of disk transfers, including 
ADT, communications, etc, see Rubywand's excellent Csa2 FAQs :

	http://home.swbell.net/rubywand/Csa2T1TCOM.html

and the documentation included with most ADT distributions.

For ADT (DOS and Windows) downloads and information :

	http://apple2.org.za/gswv/a2zine/Sel/ADTWin.html

It took me a while to set up ADT on my Apple ][ - because I didn't 
realise that my Apple ][ printer cable was a null modem cable - once 
I figured this out, I had it transferred in a few seconds.


****************************************************
 My Apple ][c and Set-Up
****************************************************

My Apple ][c has an inbuilt serial port (for driving the printer), 
and the Apple ][ printer cable is actually a Null Modem cable itself.

So, all I do is plug the Apple ][ printer cable into the serial port 
on the back of my PC and I'm ready to transfer disks.

Transferring disks is very easy with the Apple ][c - no need to set 
baud rates or mess around making cables or trying to get Super Serial 
Cards to play ball, etc.

My ][c also has 2 floppy drives - the internal drive and an external 
drive - which can save some disk swapping when doing SST transfers.

If you are looking to buy an Apple ][ for transferring disks, then I 
highly recommend that you buy the Apple ][c - but make sure that you 
get the Apple ][c printer cable as well.

I also have a Trackstar 128, but this requires a very slow bus - i.e. 
a 468 PC or better yet, a 386.


****************************************************
 Some Brief Notes about Disk Image Files
****************************************************

There are several types of Virtual Apple 2 Disk Image file used with 
Apple 2 emulators, but the main two are DSK and NIB, as follows :

  Disk Image                       File
    Type         File Size       Extension
  -----------  ---------------   ----------
    DSK         143,360 bytes      .DSK
    NIB         232,960 bytes      .NIB

NIB disk images are 1.625 times the size of DSK disk images, because 
NIB files also contain the copy protection / formatting information 
of the original disk.  DSK files don't contain this formatting, so 
these can only be used to contain images of disks from standard Apple 
DOS disks.

So, if the original floppy disk is copy protected, then you need to 
transfer the disk to the PC using additional steps.

If the original disk is not copy protected, then you can transfer the 
disk to the PC in a single step.

Standard floppy disks have formats that are DOS 3.3, ProDOS, Pascal, 
and others.

Normally, you can CATALOG these disks and see a list of files.

Copy Protected Disks have strange, non-standard formats, and usually 
you cannot CATALOG these disks - even if you boot with a standard DOS 
or ProDOS master disk and then insert the other disk and do the 
CATALOG.

Below I discuss transferring Standard Floppy Disks and Copy Protected 
Disks between the Apple 2 <-> PC.

****************************************************
 Standard Floppy Disks Problems ?
****************************************************

If you have any problems / errors, then check out your original disk 
and make sure it is fully working.  If it contains bad sectors, then 
there is nothing ADT can do to fix these errors, and your data may 
not be recoverable.  (Try Bag of Tricks or similar programs - you 
might get lucky, and they may be able to fix your original disk - and 
then you can transfer it).

When floppy disks become old (10-15+ years), then there is a real 
danger of data loss, bad sectors, and invalid sectors / data on disks 
because of the ravages of Bit Rot.  Unless you have good backups of 
these disks, then it may be too late and your data / programs may be 
lost forever.

If the disk image does not work after the transfer, and you are sure 
that your original disk is 100% good and working, then there could 
have been some sort of corruption or bad sectors on one of the floppy 
disks on the Apple 2 (something that used to happen with alarming 
regularity on real Apple 2's), or some sort of corruption in the 
transfer process, or the disk may be copy protected or it could use a 
strange format.

ADT can only handle standard Apple ][ floppy disks.  i.e. non copy 
protected disks and disks that don't have strange formats.  If you 
have these type of disks, then you need to use SST - Super Saltines 
Transcopy.

See "Transferring Copy Protected Disks" below for further details.


****************************************************
 Transferring Copy Protected Disks : Apple 2 -> PC
****************************************************

Execute SST - Super Saltines Transcopy on the Apple 2 :

    Select Menu Option 1 - Pirate a Disk

    Select Menu Option 2 - Pack

   Enter the Start Track - 0 is the default  
   - just hit enter to keep this value.

     Enter the End Track - 34 is the default 
     - just hit enter to keep this value.

                    Step - 1 is the default  
                    - just hit enter to keep this value.

      Synchronize Tracks - NO is the default 
      - just hit enter to keep this value.

            Nibble Count - NO is the default 
            - just hit enter to keep this value.

Now you are told to insert disks, and press <Return>.

So, place the Copy Protected Disk into Drive 1 on your Apple 2 and a 
blank DOS 3.3 formatted disk into Drive 2, and press <Return>.

SST will then read the copy protected disk and write this in packed, 
transferrable format onto the standard DOS 3.3 disk in Drive 2.

Only half of the image of the Copy Protected Disk can fit onto the 
blank disk in Drive 2, so at the half-way point, SST will ask you to 
place another blank formatted disk into Drive 2.

Do, this, and press <Return> and SST will complete the process.

Now, you have a 2 standard DOS 3.3 floppy disks that each contain 
half of a complete image of a Copy Protected Disk.

These Disks can then be transferred to the PC for use with emulators 
using ADT, in exactly the same as we transferred Standard Floppy 
Disks above.  (See "Transferring Standard Floppy Disks" above).

On the PC side - where you are running an Apple 2 emulator - you will 
need to use SST (running on an Apple 2 Emulator) to stitch the 2 
halves of the Copy Protected Disk's disk images back together again.

Let's say you transfer the 2 standard disks as "d1a.dsk" and 
"d1b.dsk", we now need to UnPack these disks from within the Apple 2 
Emulator on the PC to a special NIB disk image file (you could copy 
and overwrite an existing NIB file, or else download and use the 
blank.NIB file from Asimov - I'll assume you have called the NIB file 
"game.nib" on the PC) :

    Select Menu Option 1 - Pirate a Disk

    Select Menu Option 3 - UnPack

    Select Menu Option 1 - Packed Parms

   Enter the Start Track - 0 is the default  
   - just hit enter to keep this value.

     Enter the End Track - 34 is the default 
     - just hit enter to keep this value.

                    Step - 1 is the default  
                    - just hit enter to keep this value.

      Synchronize Tracks - NO is the default 
      - just hit enter to keep this value.

            Nibble Count - NO is the default 
            - just hit enter to keep this value.

Place d1a.dsk in drive 1 and game.nib in drive 2, and hit <return> to 
make SST proceed.

Then, when prompted to "turn over the disk", place d1b.dsk in drive 1 
and leave game.nib in drive 2 and hit <return> and SST will finish 
the process of rebuilding a virtual disk image copy of the original 
copy protected floppy disk.

You should then have a NIB disk image file that contains the copy 
protection / formatting information of the original disk along with 
all of the program code / data from this disk, and this disk should 
now run under emulation just as the original floppy disk runs on a 
real Apple 2, only it will be considerably faster under emulation.


****************************************************
 Transferring Copy Protected Disks : PC -> Apple 2
****************************************************

You can reverse the above process to transfer NIB disk images back to 
real floppy disks on the Apple 2.  To do this, you would use SST on 
the Apple 2 emulator to pack the NIB disk onto two .DSK disk image 
files, ADT these across onto 2 floppy disks on the real Apple 2, and 
then use SST on the real Apple 2 to unpack (stitch) these together 
again onto a single floppy disk.


***UPDATE: I don't think SST (or the version of SST that was available at this time) 
can be used to transfer / reconstruct copy protected disks back on the Apple 2.  
(I thought it could, I could have sworn that it worked, and indeed this is why 
SST was developed, but a few people have said it cannot be done, and I 
have not had a working Apple ][ for years to check it out myself).
Maybe this can be done ?
Maybe SST has been updated to do this now ?
Maybe some other software exists to do this ?
Without a working Apple ][, I cannot explore these possibilities.


****************************************************
 Copy Protected Disks Problems ?
****************************************************

If you have any problems / errors, then check out your original disk 
and make sure it is fully working.  If it contains bad sectors, then 
there is nothing SST can do to fix these errors, and your data may 
not be recoverable.  (Try Bag of Tricks or similar programs - you 
might get lucky, and they may be able to fix your original disk - and 
then you can transfer it).

When floppy disks become old (10-15+ years), then there is a real 
danger of data loss, bad sectors, and invalid sectors / data on disks 
because of the ravages of Bit Rot.  Unless you have good backups of 
these disks, then it may be too late and your data / programs may be 
lost forever.

If the NIB disk does not work after the transfer, and you are sure 
that your original disk is 100% good and working, then there could 
have been some sort of corruption or bad sectors on one of the floppy 
disks on the Apple 2 (something that used to happen with alarming 
regularity on real Apple 2's), or some sort of corruption in the 
transfer process.  So try again.  

If the resulting NIB disk still doesn't work, then the problem is 
most likely because the Copy Protection on the original disk image is 
more than SST can handle with its default settings, and you may need 
to adjust some of SST's parameters, or (if that doesn't work), then 
use some other process to transfer the disk - see below.

I have transferred well over 50 Apple 2 disks from the Apple 2 to the 
PC or from the PC back to the Apple 2, and probably only 5-10 of 
these were copy protected or had strange formats, but SST handled 
these disks perfectly every time, and straight ADT transfers handled 
the rest.

I have never heard of SST having problems with fierce / nasty / 
strange copy protection schemes - it seems to handle everything you 
can throw at it - but I guess there could be cases where SST just 
can't handle the protection / formatting of the disk.

If SST does not do the job for you, then use some other process to 
transfer the disk.  (Such as a Copy ][+ Option Board, or a TrackStar 
128 Card, or enlist the help of someone who is an expert in 
deprotecting ancient Apple 2 disks or do something else).


****************************************************
 Conclusion
****************************************************

Whatever you do, make sure you do it sooner rather than later.  The 
older your disks become, the higher the chances for errors and data 
loss.

In the late-1990's, I purchased an Apple ][c epecially to transfer 
all of my existng work from my Apple 2 days way back in 1981/82/83 
over to the PC.  However, as it turned out, I was too late, and I 
ended up losing a large number of the earliest programs and work that 
I had ever written on the Apple 2 because of old disks going bad, and 
this was very painful and sad.  I hope you don't suffer the same 
fate.  ;)

Transfer your old disks today !

All the best,
