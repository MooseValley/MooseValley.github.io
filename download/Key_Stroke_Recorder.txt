Introduction :
--------------

Key Stroke Recorder for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Key Stroke Recorder enables you to log all key presses 
and mouse button clicks on your computer so you can keep track
of what has been typed on your computer.

This program might be useful for anyone who wants to check
what someone is doing / typing on your computer.
e.g. keep track of what your teenage kids are typing while 
using the internet or any other programs.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?  What can it do ?
--------------------------------------------

If you are worried what your son, daughter, friend, spouse, 
etc might be typing on your computer, or if you are worried
about what the repair shop guys are using your computer 
for when it goes in for repairs, or if you are worried that
someone at work is using your PC after hours, then 
Key Stroke Recorder can help log what people do on your 
computer so that you can view this log later on and either
dismiss or confirm your fears.

However, there are some things you need to understand.

Note Very Well :

1. This program is a Key Stroke Recorder, so all it logs at 
   the moment is that (for example) the "A" key was pressed - not 
   that the Caps Lock or Shift key was used to produce "a" instead 
   of "A".

2. This program is a Key Stroke Recorder, so all it logs at 
   the moment is that (for example) the "2" key was pressed - not 
   that the Shift key was used to produce "@" instead of "2".

3. This program does not produce formatted log files or logs
   that accurately represent all of the input as it was typed in.

   For example, if you are in a Word Processor and type "Moose " 
   and then use the mouse to select another part of the document,
   and you type "is cute", then the log will contain :
   "MOOSE IS CUTE" as if it was all typed at one time on the same line.

   Or, if you have Mouse Button Logging turned on, then the
   log will contain : "MOOSE <LEFT Mouse> IS CUTE" as if it was 
   all typed at one time on the same line.

4. The Delete and Backspace keys do not delete characters from the log.
   So, if I type "Moose" and press the <BackSpace> key, then the
   log will contain : "MOOSE", or if you have "Log Non-Alphanumeric 
   Key Strokes" turned on, then the log will contain : 
   "MOOSE <Backspace Key>".

It is important that you understand the above.

This program simply logs keystrokes as they happen.

This program is not magical and it cannot reproduce the context 
that the key strokes were used it or where or in what application 
or in what document / file they were typed.

So, this log may or may not accurately reflect what work the user
performed on a document or file, because they may have been 
typing bits of text in at various points within that document
or within various documents / files.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\Key_Stroke\ - and run the executable 
file : Key_Stroke_Recorder.EXE.

When the program runs, it will be minimised and it will 
put an icon in the Windows Tray bar (with the Clock, etc) 
which you can click on with the mouse to bring up the 
program's main windows, view the key strokes log, etc.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu
in the program.

Advanced users may appreciate the Basic Stealth Options, 
on the "Settings" tab.  For example:

1. You can change the program's title to 
something less obvious or suspicious.  e.g. you could
change the program's name to "My Diary" or "Windows System 
Monitor" or something.

2. You can also add a password so that if someone clicks 
on the program's icon in the Windows Tray bar then they 
will not be able to see the log or use any of the program's 
functionality until they enter the password.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete Key Stroke Recorder 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever you installed
    it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

Like all of my programs, I've got tons of ideas for this 
program.

But in this case, ofcourse, I will be very cautious in what 
features I add because I don't want to do anything to help 
any hackers / crackers or anyone else out there abuse or 
misuse this program.  e.g. record passwords or information
that they have no right to record or log or view.

So, I will be very careful in providing any functionality 
that might allow damage to be done in the wrong hands.

To put it bluntly, I will not make it easier for evil people 
to rip off or snoop on good people.

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Separation and correct logging of Uppercase and Lowercase letters.

  N.B.  This program is a Key Stroke Recorder, so all it logs at 
  the moment is that (for example) the "A" key was pressed - not 
  that the Caps Lock or Shift key was used to produce "a" instead 
  of "A".

- Separation and correct logging of Shifted-Characters.  
  e.g. !, @, #, instead of 1, 2, 3.

  N.B.  This program is a Key Stroke Recorder, so all it logs at 
  the moment is that (for example) the "2" key was pressed - not 
  that the Shift key was used to produce "@" instead of "2".

- Password protection / encryption of the log file.

- Ability to limit the log file to a certain size or to a certain 
  number of lines.

- Better password protection of the program.  So, that no-one can close
  the program down unless they type the correct password.

- More / Advanced Stealth Mode Options - so that the program does 
  not appear in the Windows Task List or on the Windows Task Bar 
  or the application / process list.  i.e. people using your computer 
  will not know that this program is running or logging their 
  key strokes.

  N.B.  I can do this quite easily - but it scares the hell 
  out of me so much that I will probably never release a program 
  that does this because then this program could far more easily 
  be used for evil.

- Add in ability to only log selected users of your computer.
  e.g. If Moose logs onto your computer, then log his actions, etc.
  (This will mean that you will need to force users to log in when
   Windows starts up).

- Ability to save the log file every few minutes or so.  So, that if 
  the user switches off the PC without shutting down Windows, then
  the log file will contain all but the very latest key strokes.

- Ability to change the program's icon.  (At the moment, I have set 
  this to a Report Format icon - which is pretty inocuous and should
  not reveal the program's true functions.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.
