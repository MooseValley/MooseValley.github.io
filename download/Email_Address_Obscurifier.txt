Introduction :
--------------

Email Address Obscurifier is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 
2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

This program is especially designed for use by anyone who 
maintains or develops WEB pages, and who wants to ensure 
that email addresses (on the web page) cannot easily be 
harvested by the type of people who send junk email.

SPAM (i.e unsolicited junk email) is a rotten scurge that 
is annoying millions of internet users and causing all 
sorts of havoc due to clogged mail boxes and clogged 
servers, not to mention the nasty payloads (viruses, 
trojans, etc) that many spam emails contain.

This program can help you to obscure the email addresses 
on your web page(s) so that they act the same and function the 
same as before, but so that they cannot easily be accessed / 
identified by email harvesting programs used by people 
who send unsolicited junk email (SPAM) to 1,000's of 
internet users.

The result of this should be a reduction in the amount of 
SPAM (i.e. junk email) that you receive.

See "Using this Program" below for further information.

If this program is of interest to you, then check out 
another of my FREE programs called "Spam Analysis Tool".

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Email Address Obscurifier is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 
2000, XP, etc. This program will **NOT** run under 
Windows 3.x (even with Win32 installed) !!


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply unzip it to a directory (using 
PKUNIP, WinZIP, or similar), run it, and drag and drop spam 
email files and then click on the buttons to perform the 
various activities that you require.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

If you want this program to be "Always On Top" 
of other Windows, then select the "Always On Top"
menu option under the "File" menu.

Email Address Obscurifier enables you to enter the following 
data :

- Email Address.  e.g. moose AT move.to  (@ replaced with AT)

- "Mailto:" HTML Tag.  The default value for is "mailto:",
  and most users should be able to stick with this default 
  value.

- Email Subject Line.  i.e. the default email subject line 
  that you want to generate when the email link is selected
  on the web page,

- "Email me" Label.  This field determines how you want the 
   email link to appear on a web page.


When you press the "Obscurify" button, then valid (but obscured) 
HTML is generated for the following output fields : 
- Obscurified Output Fields
- Complete Email HTML

In addition, a "Mini-Pseudo WEB Browser" area shows you what the 
obscurified Complete Email HTML will look like and act like on the web page.
You can even click on this link and an email will be created (but NOT sent)
with the defaults you specified above.  e.g. To the desired email address, 
with the required subject line, etc.

You can then manually replace the email links on all of your web pages
with the obscurified Complete Email HTML, and this will offer increased 
protection from SPAM.

For example, a simple WEB page may consist of the following 
Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) :

	<HTML>
	For further details about my shareware, please
	<a href="mailto:moose AT move.to?subject=Shareware Catalog> 
	Email moose ATmove.to</a>
	for a full catalog.
	</HTML>    (@ replaced with AT)

The problem with this HTML code is that the email address is 
extremely easy to identify - it is the text with an ampersand "@" 
in the middle - and it is even listed twice in this HTML.

SPAMmers use special software that scans web pages for email 
addresses and extracts them for later use in sending bulk junk 
emails to many 1,000's of internet users.

After being "Obscurified", the above HTML would look like this :

	<HTML>
	For further details about my shareware, please
	<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#109;&#111;
	&#111;&#115;&#101;&#64;&#109;&#111;&#118;&#101;&#46;&#116;
	&#111;&#63;&#115;&#117;&#98;&#106;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#61;&#83;
	&#104;&#97;&#114;&#101;&#119;&#97;&#114;&#101;&#32;&#67;&#97;
	&#116;&#97;&#108;&#111;&#103;"> &#69;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;
	&#32;&#109;&#111;&#111;&#115;&#101;&#64;&#109;&#111;&#118;
	&#101;&#46;&#116;&#111;</a>
	for a full catalog.
	</HTML>

As you can see, the email address is now no longer easy to locate.

To people visiting the web page, the web page will look and act 
exactly as before.  However, it will now be much more difficult 
for email harvesting programs to identify and extract email 
addresses from this web page.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete this program
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !

Before deleting the program, you should turn off 
the auto-running of this program under Windows - 
if you have previously enabled it.  Simply, re-select 
the option under the File Menu in the program to 
achieve this.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- More advanced obscuring options - via JAVA Script code, etc.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, 
what feedback I get, etc.
