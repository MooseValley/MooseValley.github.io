Introduction :
--------------

Life Clock for Windows 3.1, 3.11, 95, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

This program displays :

- the current date / time, and,

- the amount of time you might have left to live 
  (in years:days:hours:mins:secs format) based on 
  the settings you enter in the Setup Screen 
  (found via the File | Settings menu).

I wrote this program because I read about a new 
watch that displays the amount of time you might 
have left to live, and which sold for 
$140 (Australian dollars).  (See "Inspiration 
for this Program" below).

I have not seen this watch, but my program reproduces 
the functionality described in this article.

The aim of this program is that it makes you 
realise that time is passing and it attempts to 
scare you into living.  i.e. don't delay,
start living and achieving your goals today !

Thanks to my brother, Frank, for inspiring me
to write this program, and for finding and faxing
me the article below.


Inspiration for this Program :
------------------------------

Sunday Morning Herald, Feb 16, 1997.  (Melbourne, Australia).
(Typed in by Moose O'Malley, with all words, syntax,
punctuation, etc intact as per the original article).
(Thanks to my brother, Frank, for finding and faxing the 
article to me).

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN

TIME waits for no man - so the saying goes.  But if
you like the idea of counting the passing hours, the new
Timisis digital clock may hold a fascination.

What makes this timepiece unique is that rather than
displaying the time, it shows you how many minutes and 
seconds you can expect to have left in your life.  As its
default setting, the clock presumes men will live to 75
and women 80.  But if you are super fit - or in
desperate need of a workout - you can reconfigure
the setting accordingly.

According to its US inventor, Chip Altholz, "the 
Timisis clock scares you into living".

The Clock also has the facility to display 150
motivational messages (if you buy the clock you will
probably need them).  Priced at $140 [Australian], 
the Timisis clock will only be available through 
specialist stores.


The Future :
-------------

In the future, I would like to add a screen that enables
you to enter your health / life style details (such as
whether you smoke, whether you are overweight, gender,
how often you exercise, etc), and have the program
estimate estimate your life span based on this.

I saw a quiz (in a women's magazine) based on this years 
ago, but, regretably, I didn't keep the article.

If anyone has a quiz that can help determine your 
life span, please email it to me.

Other things I could do are :
- Add the display of a random motivational message / tip
  each time the program is run.
- Add in sounds / warning messages when various stages
  of your life are reached.  Such as when the program thinks
  you have 1 year to live.
- Add in a birthday greeting each year.
- and so on.


Program Estimates Warranty :
----------------------------

This program shows how long you might have to live.

The program is in no way accurate, and there are
no accurate algorithms in use to guess your life span.

Please do not rely on this program to estimate your 
life span.

Do not blame me if you believe this program and spend all
your money believing you might soon die, but then live
for another 20 years.  Also, do not blame me if the 
program suggests you might die in 20 years and you die 
today.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.0     28-Feb-97   First Public Release.
1.1     04-Apr-97   Add in extra date / validation / error handling 
                    code.
1.2     25-Apr-97   Fix a problem with date validation
                    experienced by several USA users.
1.3     16-Jun-97   Save settings automatically on Windows 95 shutdown 
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Start Minimised if set in Shortcut / settings
                    (Registered Users only).  
                    Improve application startup - size and position 
                    form before user sees it.
                    Add in Menu items for viewing my Shareware Catalog, 
                    the Readme file, and the Registration Form.
                    Display the current time in red on a black 
                    background to make it look a bit like an LED 
                    clock.  
1.4     11-Jan-98   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (2,832 lines of code.)
1.5     25-Sep-98   Add in the display of your age / time remaining
                    in "years:days:hh:mm:ss" format.
                    Add in the option to seperate date output by
                    ':' or 'y', 'd', 'h', 'm', and 's'.
                    Add in autosizing of the main window to handle
                    long date outputs.
                    (3,214 lines of code.)

1.6   01-Feb-2001   Store the INI settings file in the program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    Fix an old bug in Borland Delphi / Windows NT
                    to fix NTDLL.DLL errors on closedown which 
                    occured on some Windows NT configurations.
                    Ensure that the user's currently selected ShortDate in Windows
                    has the century in it so that dates are handled correctly.
                    If the user doesn't have the century in the ShortDate format, 
                    this program will add it in for its own use.
                    (6,579 lines of code / comments.)

1.7  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (7,212 lines of code / comments.)

1.7b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (31,498 lines of code / comments.)

1.7f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.

If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is possibly an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my WEB page - see below.
