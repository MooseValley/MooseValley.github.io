Introduction :
--------------

Font Reviewer is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, or 
later.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Font Reviewer allows you to view all fonts installed on your computer and
see any text you like written in any or all of the fonts that you select.

Font Reviewer was developed to make font selections simple, fast, easy, 
and painless.

You can chose any or all of the following pre-defined pieces of text :
- The Font's Name and Size (in an Arial font)
- The Font's Name (in it's own font)
- ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
- abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
- The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.
- THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOGS.
- 01234567890

And/or you can enter any text you like and see it written in all 
of the selected fonts.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Font Reviewer is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, or 
later.  This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!

Why I Wrote this Program :
--------------------------

I like using different fonts and I have over 415 fonts installed 
on my PC - and that's nothing compared to what I've had in the past.

The problem is, it is impossible to remember what fonts are 
installed or what they look like.

When selecting a font to use for a piece of work, it is usually a 
tedious, time consuming, manual loathsome process.

You know the deal.  In a Word processor, to see what a piece of text 
looks like in a particular font, you have to go through and select a 
font and see what the text looks like, and then change the font and 
see what the text loks like with that font, and so on.

It is tedious job, and half the time you like a font that 
you saw near the start, so you have to search all the way 
through again.  And, when you are dealing with 100's of fonts, 
this is a slow, error prone, and very tedious job.

So, while looking for a font recently, I decided that I'd had 
enough of this messing around, and, as I usually do, I decided 
to write a program to help me.

This program was called "Font Reviewer".

Font Reviewer has already saved me many hours of tedious work.

I hope you also find the program useful.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\Font_Reviewer\ - and run the 
executable file : Font_Reviewer.EXE.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu 
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Using this Program :
--------------------

Select the pieces ofg text you would like to be written in the 
selcted fonts.

If you have any special text (that isn't already in the list)
that you would like written in the selected fonts, then 
enter it in the "Other Text" edit box and make sure that the 
"Other Text" checkbox is checked.

To select or unselect fonts, click the checkbox in front of 
their names, or use the buttons on the right-hand side of the 
fonts list.

To invert your font selections (i.e. make all selectyed fonts
unselected and vica versa), then use the "Invert" button.

Then click the "Report" button, and you will see a report 
containing each of the selected text items written in each 
of the selected fonts.

The program should hopefully be pretty easy and straight forward to use.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete this program 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Before doing this however :

- If you have selected / enabled the "Auto-Run at Windows 
  Startup" option (under the File menu), then you should 
  ensure that this option is not checked / enabled 
  (which you can easily do by re-selecting the 
  "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" option from under 
  the File menu).

- If you have used any of the "Create Shortcut ..." options 
  under the File menu, then you should use the "Delete All 
  Shortcuts" option under the File menu to remove these from
  your system.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Save and Load the fonts that are selected between program runs 
  and between font list refreshes.  So, the selected fonts are 
  preserved even as more fonts are added to your system.

- Add an option to allow you to insert a blank line between report 
  segments or not.  i.e. leave a blank line between the chunks
  of the report for each font.

- The ability to delete / uninstall selected fonts.

- The ability to delete / uninstall all but the default fonts 
  that are installed on your system during a standards Windows 
  install.

- Anything else ??  Let me know.

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
