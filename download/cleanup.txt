Introduction :
--------------

Clean-Up Old Files for Windows 95 / 98 / NT / 2000.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Clean-Up Old Files enables the user to specify one or more directories,
and then periodically clean out / erase / delete files that haven't
been modified for a certain number of days.

The program enables the user to specify :
- The directories where files will be deleted.
- The age (in days) of files to be deleted.  i.e. if the file
  hasn't been changed for this many days or more, it will be deleted.
  (Registered Users Only !)
- How often the deletion is to be performed.  e.g. every 24 hours.
- Whether they should be prompted / warned before any files are deleted.
- Whether the program should run automatically at Windows Start-Up.

WARNING : THIS PROGRAM DELETES FILES.  USE THIS PROGRAM WITH EXTREME CAUTION.
          USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK !

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Clean-Up Old Files for Windows 95 / 98 / NT / 2000.
This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Using this Program :
--------------------

WARNING : THIS PROGRAM DELETES FILES.  USE THIS PROGRAM WITH EXTREME CAUTION.
          USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK !

When this program runs, it sits in the Windows Tray bar (with the clock, etc).

To bring up the program (i.e. make the program's main screen is visible), simply 
click on the program's "Machine Cog" icon in the tray bar.

When the program's main screen is visible you can specify :

- The directories where files will be deleted - via the Add, 
  Remove, and Reset buttons.

    >>> Installation Default = No Directories (i.e. No files !)

- The age (in days) of files to be deleted.  i.e. if the file
  hasn't been changed for this many days, it will be deleted.

    >>> Installation Default = 90 days.

- How often (in hours) the deletion is to be performed.

    >>>  Installation Default = 24 hours.

- Whether they should be prompted / warned before any files are deleted.

    >>> Installation Default = Yes, prompt the user *before* ANY files are deleted.

- Whether the program should run automatically at Windows Start-Up.

    >>> Installation Default = No, do NOT run at Windows Start-Up.

When the program is first installed, all settings are 100% SAFE - that is, 
the program cannot and will not delete anything until the user specifically
tells it to.

The user can override / alter any of these settings (with un-safe settings), 
and then these will become the new defaults every time the program is run.

To make the program go back to the tray bar, click the Minimise button or
the standard Windows minimise icon (the leftmost icon in the top right hand 
corner of the program's window).

While the program is in the tray bar, it is still active, and will delete files
according to its settings.

To make this program run automatically whever Windows starts, simply create a 
Shortcut to the programs EXEcutable in the Windows Startup directory.

WARNING : THIS PROGRAM DELETES FILES.  USE THIS PROGRAM WITH EXTREME CAUTION.
          IF YOU DELETE ANY USEFUL FILES WITH THIS PROGRAM THEN THAT IS
          YOUR FAULT, AND I WILL ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY.


The Future :
------------

In the future, various improvements could be made to this program,
for example :
- Add in the ability to handle the Recycle Bin

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0   1-Sep-2000    First PRIVATE Release.
                    (7,803 lines of code / comments.)

                    A little bit of History ....

                    This program was originally developed specially for 
                    a company in the USA.  A fully working program, built
                    to their precise specifications, was delivered to them 
                    in good faith, but they welched out of paying and would 
                    not answer my emails any more.  Rotten Welchers !!

                    So now, 5 months later, I am adding it to my shareware 
                    catalog.

2.0   22-Jan-2001   First PUBLIC Release.
                    Add in "Restore Factory Defaults" menu option.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's 
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    Add in "Exit Program After Next Deletion" setting option.
                    (Registered Users Only !)
                    Add in option to Append Deleted Files to a Log, and
                    add in a button to view this log in Windows Notepad.
                    Add in an "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" menu option to help
                    the user make this program run automatically at Windows Startup.
                    This saves you creating a shortcut to the program in the Windows
                    StartUp folder !!
                    In addition, if you move the program to a new directory or drive,
                    it will automatically sense that its existing auto-run command
                    needs updating to the program's new location.  Very cool !!
                    (8,182 lines of code / comments.)

2.1   17-Apr-2001   Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (9,245 lines of code / comments.)

2.1b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (33,037 lines of code / comments.)

2.1f  17-Jan-2010   This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.
                    (50,496 lines of code / comments.)
