Introduction :
--------------

Periodic Table is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Periodic Table is a program to help you investigate, look
up, or compare the details for all known elements.  e.g.
Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, etc.

Periodic Table includes :

- A standard Periodic Table of Elements - if you click an element, 
  then a report for the selected element is displayed.
  You can also find an element by name or abbreviation - to make it 
  easier to look up elements - by using the buttons or menu options
  provided.

- 16 Element Comparison Graphs to let you compare criteria
  for each element.  e.g. Atomic Radius, Atomic Weight,
  Boiling Point (K), Melting Point (K), Electrical Conductivity,
  etc.

All data (including the reports and graphs !) can be copied 
to Windows Clipboard at the click of a button, so that you can 
then paste them into your own documents and use them in your 
own projects / research / web pages / etc.

If you do use this information or the reports or graphs in
your own own projects / research / web pages / etc, then 
please provide a link to my WEB page.

All data has been checked against various text books and internet 
sources, however, there was a lot of variation in the details 
these sources presented - see "Accuracy of the Data Presented"
below.

A Glossary of Terms is provided within the program to explain 
the terms used within this program.

There are buttons and menu options to enable you to : 

  1. Copy an image of the Periodic Table to Windows' Clipboard,
     so you can paste it into a document in your word processor 
     or spreadsheet or whatever.

  2. Save an image of the Periodic Table to file,
     so you can load this and use this elsewhere, as needed.

  3. Set the Window's Desktop to be an image of the Periodic 
     Table, so the Periodic Table is there in the background 
     all the time.

All of this functionality works according to the current size 
of the program's main window - so if you want a bigger image, 
then make the main window bigger before invoking these functions.
e.g. use the Maximise icon in the top right hand corner (title bar).

This program should be useful to anyone who wants to 
learn more about the elements that make up our universe.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
--------------------------------------------

Periodic Table programs are a "dime a dozen" on the internet,
and many are freeware or shareware, so why did I bother to
develop yet another Periodic Table program ??

This is a program I have wanted to write / develop for ages.

However, I have not done this because of the massive number 
of programs already written on the Periodic Table.

Over the past few years, I have been reading a lot about 
the planets and options for human colonisation and expansion, 
and in particular, I have been reading about TerraForming.

Terraforming is a process of planetary engineering, specifically 
directed at enhancing the capacity of an extraterrestrial planetary 
environment to support life. The ultimate in terraforming would be 
to create an uncontained planetary biosphere emulating all the 
functions of the biosphere of the Earth---one that would be fully 
habitable for human beings.  (Definition courtesy of M.J. Fogg)

So, a good Periodic Table was a step towards understanding how 
we could TerraForm another planet.

In early October, 2002, I checked out a whole swag of "FREEWARE"
programs, and none of these included the latest details of the 
most recently found elements.  Most were very old, and they
were quite primitive and some contained many flaws.

Then I checked out a whole swag of "SHAREWARE" programs, and 
these were much better, but they were either inaccurate or else 
they were so crippled so that I could not look up more than a 
few elements.  

None of the dozen or so programs I reviewed included a glossary
of terms (unlike my Periodic Table program), and I wasn't 
completely happy with any of them.

So, as I usually do, I just sat down and finally wrote my own 
program - and Periodic Table of Elements is the result.

Prices for these other shareware programs started at $20 US, and
most authors were asking between $35 US and $50 US.  

The price for my Periodic Table program is $10 Aussie dollars 
(which equals $5 US approx) - a real bargain in comparison !!


Accuracy of the Data Presented :
--------------------------------

All data has been checked against various text books and 
internet sources, however, there was a lot of variation 
in the details these sources presented, so I cannot be 
certain that everything is 100% correct.

Compiling this information and checking it against
multiple sources to verify every single figure has
been a major piece of work - requiring many long nights.

The following Periodic Table / Chemistry web sites have
been used to double check key figures for all elements :

	http://chemlab.pc.maricopa.edu/periodic/

In addition, my Encyclopeadia Britanica DVD has also 
provided some assistance in this.

If anyone finds any errors in any values presented 
in the program, then please make sure that you have 
the latest version of the program.  (i.e. download 
this from my web page - see below).

If you are using the latest version of the program,
and you still believe that this has errors and you 
are sure that your units and numbers are correct, 
then please email me and let me know, 
what values you think are wrong and why, and what the 
correct values should be.  

I will then look at things and check things out, and 
if I can confirm the errors, then I will fix these 
and prepare a new version of the program.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\Chemistry\ - and run the executable 
file : Periodic_Table.EXE.

You can also drag and drop shortcuts to this program
onto your Desktop or Start Menu using Windows Explorer.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu
in the program.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete Periodic Table
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !


Glossary of Terms :
-------------------

A Glossary of Terms is provided within the program to 
explain the terms used within this program.

This Glossary is now accessible from within the program.  
e.g. press the "Glossary" button or use the "Glossary of 
Terms" option under the Help menu.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- More information on each element, especially :
  * Colour
  * Odour
  * Flammable in Earth's Atmosphere
  * Ductile
  * Malleable
  * Hardness (Mo)
  * Abundance in Universe
  * Abundance in our Solar System
  * Abundance on Earth
  * Abundance in Earth's Atmosphere
  * Abundance in Earth's Oceans
  * Compressability
  * Essential to human or animal life as we know it
  * Toxic to human or animal life as we know it
  * Essential to plant life as we know it
  * Toxic to plant life as we know it
  * Number of isotopes
  * Half-Life (if applicable)
  * Half-life for the longest and shortest lived isotopes.
  * Uses / Applications
  * etc, etc, etc

  There are many dozens of things that can be added into 
  this program for each element.

- More Graphs.

- The ability to "ZOOM" in on the graphs - so you can see 
  what is going on in more detail.

- Ability to extract any or all data for each element from 
  the program so you can use this data in your own reports
  or spreadsheets.

- Form Scaling, Maximise functionality.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :

Amendment History :
-------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0  14-Oct-2002    First Public Release.
                    (30,580 lines of code / comments.)

1.1  15-Oct-2002    You can now choose your own colours - i.e. you can now 
                    left or right mouse click on the coloured boxes in the
                    "Element Group Key / Legend", and select new colours for
                    each group of elements.
                    Add in an on-line Glossary of Terms - this is
                    accessible from within the program.  e.g. press the
                    "Glossary" button or use the "Glossary of Terms" option 
                    under the Help menu.
                    From now on, only Registered users can copy the Glossary 
                    of Terms and Element Reports to Window's Clipboard.
                    Improve the formatting of some numbers / data.
                    e.g. Show 1.2300 as 1.23, etc on the element reports.
                    (31,314 lines of code / comments.)

2.0  17-Oct-2002    This is a fairly Massive Update !!!!
                    Double check all key values (Atomic Weight, Atomic Radius, 
                    Boiling Point, Melting Point, Density, Bonding Covalent
                    Radius, Electron Negativity, etc) against other sources - 
                    such as various Periodic Table / Chemistry web sites, 
                    especially : http://chemlab.pc.maricopa.edu/periodic/
                    and my Encyclopeadia Britanica DVD.
                    It has been very hard work - as no two information sources
                    seem to 100% agree on the details for each element.
                    However, I am now much more confident in the accuracy of 
                    the information presented in this program.
                    Add in some additional details about each element - such
                    as interesting properties, uses, or facts.
                    Add in the Discoverer and the Year of Discovery (where known).
                    For elements that have been know since ancient times (copper, 
                    lead, etc), the Year of Discovery was nominated to be -1,000 
                    (i.e. 1000 B.C.) just to provide a more representative range 
                    on the Year of Discovery graph.
                    Add a few additional terms into the Glossary of Terms.
                    Add more descriptive Acid / Base properties : use Strong,
                    Mild, and Weak for Acids and Bases.
                    Add in column (group) headings : Ia, IIa, IIIa, etc.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's 
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    Add in support for the Maximise icon in the top right 
                    corner of the program's main window.
                    Various minor usability enhancements : you can now left
                    or right mouse click on any element to view the report,
                    display the number of terms in the Glossary, etc.
                    Improve the and compact the interface - use StaticText
                    components instead of the previous Groupbox + Label.
                    Add in buttons and menu options to provide the user with 
                    the ability to : 
                    1. Copy an image of the Periodic Table to Windows' Clipboard,
                    2. Save an image of the Periodic Table to file, and,
                    3. Set the Window's Desktop to be an image of the Periodic Table.
                    All of these work according to the current size of the 
                    program's main window - so if you want a bigger image, then
                    make the main window bigger before invoking these functions.
                    (36,252 lines of code / comments.)

2.0b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (41,867 lines of code / comments.)

2.1   30-June-2003  Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Add in support for all of the various Windows
                    Regional Settings for numbers. 
                    i.e. Allow people to use something other than a 
                    full stop as the decimal point, and something 
                    other than a comma as a 1,000's separator.
                    (Special thanks to Mathijs for reporting this issue).
                    (69,905 lines of code / comments.)

2.2    2-Feb-2005   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Fix the truncation of significant leading zeroes on the 
                    Element Properties reports.
                    (Special thanks to Blane P for reporting this issue).
                    (71,828 lines of code / comments.)

2.2f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.
