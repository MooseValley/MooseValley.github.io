Introduction :
--------------

File Usage Monitor is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, 
netbooks, etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which 
includes Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

File Usage Monitor simply monitors and logs the usage of files that 
you want to monitor: how many hours each file has been open / in use, 
the date/time it was opened, the date/time it was closed, etc.
for any files you want to monitor.

I use File Usage Monitor to keep track of various documents,  spreadsheets, 
and files that I work on so that I can tell when the files were last changed, 
when I last worked on them, how long I have worked on them for, and so on.

File Usage Monitor also records the date / time each time that it is started 
(executed, run) and ended (exited, closed) in the event log.

The program resides in the Windows Icon Tray (with the clock, etc).
Its icon has a green eye with the word "File" on it.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.


How to use File Usage Monitor :
-------------------------------

File Usage Monitor's main screen consists of a tabbed notebook \
with a series of tabs:

(1). Files Monitored tab: 
This tab contains a grid consisting of 3 columns which display the name(s) of 
any files being monitored, the current status of each file (open, closed, etc), 
and the number of hours (usage time) that the file has been locked 
(open, in use).

The buttons down the left hand side enable you to add files to be monitored, 
remove files from being monitored, reset the usage time for a selected file 
or for all files, and buttons to pause and resume the logging of file usage.

(2).  Event / Status Log tab:
This tab shows the event log for File Usage Monitor, which contains:

* the events and status for all files that are being monitored (the 
date/time that each file was locked (open, in use) and closed.

* the date / time every time File Usage Monitor was started and ended, 

The log is sorted into File Path + Name order, and then in 
chronological date/time order for each file.

The buttons down the left hand side enable you to are to copy the log to 
Windows Clipboard, copy the log in TAB separated format to Windows Clipboard 
(makes it *very* easy to paste the data into columns in a spreadsheet, 
if this is required), and erase the log.

(3). Settings tab:
This tab contains the following settings:

* whether to stop logging file usage after so many seconds of mouse inactivity 
(however many seconds you specify),

* whether to auto-save settings and the log file every so 
many minutes (however many minutes you specify).

The log file and all settings are automatically saved when File Usage Monitor
is closed and when Windows is Shutsdown and when you log off from your user 
account.  And the log file and all settings are also auto-saved every nn minutes 
(however many minutes you specify, if the "auto-save" checkbox is ticked on 
the Settings tab).

All buttons in this program have Tooltips, so just let the 
mouse pointer hover over the button and pretty soon a 
Tool Tip help will appear to explain what the button does.

If a CPU lockout occurs or the PC hangs for a while, I have 
especially coded the program so that such lockouts are
ignored in the log.  i.e. time will not be added to the
logged usage for a file while the PC is hung.


Why is this useful ?  Why do this ?
-----------------------------------

In many service oriented companies - particularly in Legal Offices, 
Accountants, Graphic Designers, Computer Consultancies, etc customers 
and clients are billed for each hour of work done on their behalf.

File Usage Monitor enables these companies to justify / support
work invoices sent to clients by logging the amount of
time spent working on the computer files related to each client.

Other uses include helping staff in companies fill in 
detailed time / task recording sheets which may require you to
log what work you did during each hour of the day.

These logs will be accurate as long as you are disciplined: open 
a file, do whatever work is needed on it, and then close the file 
straight away when you have finished working on it.

As far as I know, nothing like this application exists already,
and this application is completely unique.

I like keeping track of various files and the history of when they 
have been edited / worked on / in use.

For example, I keep track of several of my VirtualBox Virtual Machines
so that I know when, for example, I last checked my various email accounts, etc.
(I do ALL of my internet browsing and email checking, etc inside sandboxes inside 
Virtual Machines, so that if I accidentally visit a "malware web site" or open 
an email that contains malware, then only the sandbox gets hit.  This limits all 
potential damage / infection and it can be completely erased with the click of a 
mouse button).  Anyway, I track the hard-disk image files for my various 
virtual machines with File Usage Monitor so that I have a full log of when 
I last checked my emails, and various other activities.

I use File Usage Monitor to keep track of various documents,  spreadsheets, 
and files that I work on so that I can tell when the files were last changed, 
when I last worked on them, how long I have worked on them for, and so on.


Monitoring How Long Windows has been running :
----------------------------------------------

I also use File Usage Monitor to keep track of how long Windows has 
been running, when Windows was started and shut down, etc.

To do this under Windows NT, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, add the 
"pagefile.sys" file to File Usage Monitor (in the c:\ folder by default).

To do this under "ancient" versions of Windows 95, 98, ME, etc add the 
"Win386.swp" file to File Usage Monitor (in the c:\ folder by default).


Limitations of File Usage Monitor :
----------------------------------

This program can only log file usage if file locking occurs.  
e.g.  When you edit a document in MS Word, Word "locks" the 
document to prevent other accesses until you finish editing 
and close the document.  Excel, Power Point, Lotus 1-2-3, 
Access, WordPerfect, Corel Draw, and most large commercial 
packages perform this locking.

Some programs, like Notepad, Word Pad, Paint Shop Pro, etc 
do NOT lock your files while they are being worked on.  As 
a result of this, File Usage Monitor cannot log any access 
to files within these programs.

If you are not sure whether the application(s) you are using 
lock open files, add a file that you are editing in that 
application to File Usage Monitor and see if the "File Status" 
changes while the file is being edited in the particular application.


The Future :
-------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- More file type filters in the "Add File" dialog.  If you need 
  any other filters, please let me know.  :)
  
- Add a Client column so that the hours spent working on 
  all files for a client can be easily seen.
  Does anyone need this ?
  
- Add in a Client Report button which generates a report 
  containing : File name, logged work time (in Hours), 
  with a month by month breakdown and an overall total.
  Does anyone need this ?

- Add in Sort functionality to sort on the various columns.
  Does anyone need this ?

- Add in the ability to ignore file usage events of less 
  than 15 seconds (or whatever you specify).
  Does anyone need this ?

- Group Working functionality to generate reports for each 
  client even when many people are working on files relating 
  to the client.
  Does anyone need this ?

- Anything else ?  Just Email me with suggestions / comments !!

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Special Thanks to :

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0   18-Apr-1997   First Public Release.
                    Thank to my brother for his original and brilliant 
                    idea for this program.  :)

1.1   24-May-1997   Save settings automatically on Windows shutdown 
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Start Minimised if set in Shortcut / settings
                    (Registered Users only).  
                    Improve application startup - size and position 
                    form before user sees it.
                    Put a Status Bar at the bottom of the Main 
                    Window to hold Icon & object tool tips.
                    Add in Menu items for viewing my Shareware 
                    Catalog, Readme file, and Registration Form.

1.2   13-Jun-1997   Save Window Height and Width on exit, and 
                    enable Main Window to be resized.
                    Build a 32 bit version for Windows 95 / NT
                    which enables Long File Names to be used, and
                    also enables File Usage Monitor to be placed
                    on the Icon Tray.
                    Make the "Add Files to be Monitored" button
                    multi-select, so you can add many files at once.
                    Add in a "Reset Usage" for all files button.

1.3   11-Jan-1998   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (3,216 lines of code / comments.)

1.4   18-Jul-2000   Add in the ability to Pause logging if a certain
                    period of mouse inactivity is encountered.
                    (Added in specially for Mark Radford).
                    (6,691 lines of code / comments.)

1.5  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (8,381 lines of code / comments.)

1.5b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (28,694 lines of code / comments.)

1.5f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.

1.6f  27-Mar-2015   Remove all of the sub-forms / sub screens and place all user interface 
                    components in a tabbed notebook on the program's main screen.
                    Add in functionality to save File Usage Monitor's settings and 
                    the File Usage Log periodically (say every 5 minutes, or whatever 
                    you specify), to minimise the impact of a crash, power failure, 
                    etc.
                    Add a Detailed Log for each file being monitored so 
                    that you can see the various start / stop dates / times 
                    for when work was undertaken on each particular file.
                    Record the start/stop dates and times for File Usage Monitor to the log.
                    Add a 2nd "Clipboard Copy" button on the "Event / Status Log" tab 
                    which copies  the log in TAB separated format to Windows Clipboard 
		    (makes it *very* easy to paste the data into columns in a spreadsheet).
                    Change the name of the program and readme file names from "File_mon" 
                    to the much more meaningful and appropriate "File_Usage_Monitor".  :)
                    Add exception handling to the loading and saving of program settings (INI file)
                    so that the program executes and exits cleanly (no error messages produced) even 
                    if running from a read-only device such as a optical disk (CD-ROM, etc) or 
                    there are disk errors or the disk is full and/or the INI file does not exist 
                    and/or it cannot be created.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (1,078 lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (36,712 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all source, library, and include files.)

2.0f  12-Apr-2015   WOW, another big update, and just weeks after the last update.  
                    I've been putting a lot of hours of work into this program recently.
                    Add filtering for other file types in the "Add Files" dialog: 
                    * Wordprocessor documents (*.doc;*.docx;*.odt;*.fodt)
                    * Spreadsheets (*.xls;*.xlsx;*.ods;*.fods)
                    * Presentations (*.ppt;*.pps;*.pptx;*.odp;*.fodp)
                    * Virtual hard-drive files (*.vmdk;*.vdi;*.vhd;*.hdd;*.qed;*.qcow;*.qcow2;*.vhdx)
                    If you need any other filters, let me know.  :)
                    Access all files in read-only mode - this is required when monitoring 
                    Windows Vista, 7, 8, etc pagefiles from a "standard user" level account.
                    Add "Drag and Drop" support so you can drag and drop files from Windows 
                    Explorer onto File Usage Monitor's window and they will be added to 
                    the list of files being monitored.
                    Add an information dialog when adding files to be monitored: display 
                    the number of files added, the number of files that were already being 
                    monitored (and therefore weren't added to the list again), and so on.
                    Add mouse wheel scrolling to the grid and log interface components.
                    Add the "Update the status of all files every seconds" timer interval 
                    setting to the Settings tab so you can change this to whatever you want.
                    The default value is 5 seconds.  Warning: if you are monitoring the status 
                    of 100's of files on an ancient / slow computer, then set the delay 
                    to something reasonable.  e.g. 5+ seconds - not 1 second !
                    Display the application name and version number (rather than just the 
                    program's EXE name) when the mouse hovers over the application's icon 
                    in the Windows TrayBar.
                    Record in the log when files are added to / removed from the monitored list.
                    Display the number of files being monitored in the program's title bar.
                    Remove the horizontal scroll bar from the grid - it was not needed, because 
                    the grid automatically expans to fill the available space.
                    Make the Remove and Reset Usage buttons multi-select friendly - so you can now 
                    select multiple files in the grid and remove them or reset their usage hours.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (1,419 lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (37,059 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all source, library, and include files.)
