Text Screen Grab v0.1 (May 1987) for DOS.            by Moose O'Malley

FREE Ware !


This is a DOS memory resident (TSR) program, 
which allows you to grab TEXT from other applications.

Basically, it pops up over the top of these applications
and grabs their text screens !!

Output is written to an output file of your 
choice. (default is PRINT.MIK ).

To activate the program :
1.  Run the program by typing SCREEN
2.  hit ALT-P when you want to select a TEXT screen to 
    write to the file.
3.  Select file to write, and if you want to add to 
    it or start over.

The output file (you write screens to) can then 
be edited (if required) by any editor that accepts 
ASCII Files (eg. SideKick, Turbo editor, etc).

There is no limit to the size the file can be (except 
for normal DOS restrictions).

Conflicts may occur between other memory resident 
programs, or other large programs and this one.  The 
only way out of this is to REBOOT the system.

The program is so old, it probably won't like Windows !!

It is FREE Ware, and you can copy, distribute, and 
use it freely as long as this message remains intact.

The program operates in character mode only.  i.e. it is not a graphical
program, so it will work on any monitor : CGA, EGA, VGA, etc, and 
will run on any PC (with an Intel CPU from 8088 to Pentium Pro), 
and with any amount of memory (it only needs a few dozen KB).

It runs on my 8086 640 KB CGA laptop, and it runs (at the same speed) 
on my Pentium 100 / 16 MB / SVGA.

It also runs under Windows 3.1, 95, NT, but as a DOS application.

This program was written in Turbo Pascal v3 / v5 (DOS).
