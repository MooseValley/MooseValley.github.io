MineSweeper :
--------------

MineSweeper is a simple game that runs under the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM).

MineSweeper is my clone of the Windows Game "MineSweeper".

How to Play:
* Left mouse click: select squares that you hope aren't mines.
* Right mouse click: flag squares that you think are mines.
* Use the number inside the squares to work out where nearby mines are.
* Keep going until you have selected all squares or hit a mine.

Also:
* Use Ctrl + Mouse Wheel Up/Down to increase / decrease font size
(just like you can do on a web page).

This game will run on ANY operating system that is capable of
running the JVM, including desktops, laptops, and tablets running
Windows, Linux, Unix, etc, such as PCs, Macs, Raspberry PI, etc.

I never really played MineSweeper much until early 2018, and then
I realised what a terrific game it is.  So, on a rainy Sunday morning,
I created my own version.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company,
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

And then, double click on:

The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Better sound effects, more sound effetcs, etc.

- Game levels: easy, hard, super hard, Oh come on !!!,
you've got to be joking, etc.

- Different modes of play, 2 or more Players, internet play,
play by email, etc.

- Anything else ?

suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.
