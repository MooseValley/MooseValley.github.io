Introduction :
--------------

Words Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion for 
Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Words Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion
provides some very useful functionality and is especially
suited to people who like playing scrabble, or doing 
crosswords, or using anyone who needs to look up words
or use words in other ways.

Words Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion 
features include :

- A Sample list of only 938 words.
  You cna use any word lists you like - including lists of up to 
  263,535 words (that are available on my web site).

  (Due to file size restrictions on my WEB site, this list of 
  words needs to be downloaded separately - see my WEB page 
  for details).

- Ability to do wild card searches : you can use ? (question mark) 
  to represent a single letter, or * (asterisk) to represent one 
  or more letters.  

  Example #1: a??i? will find all 5 letter words starting with 
              'a' and having a 4th letter of 'i'.  e.g. acrid.
  Example #2: ac*al will find all words starting with 'ac' and 
              ending in 'al'.  e.g. accidental.
  Example #3: ac* will find all words starting with 'ac'.
  Example #4: *dent will find all words starting with 'dent'.
  Example #5: ?? find all two letter words.

- Ability to do letter / template / anagram searches :
  1. Search for words containing at least 1 of each of these 
     letters and any other letters.
  2. Search for words containing only these letters and at 
     least 1 of each letter.
  3. Search for words containing only these letters and only 
     the specified number of each letter.

- Ability to do Phonetic Searches, so you can now search for all
  words that sound more or less like another word.

- You can limit the words returned by these searches to a
  certain range of lengths.  e.g. only return words between
  5 and 10 characters long.

- Word List Maintenance :
  1. Ability to erase the included word list and build your own 
     words lists.
  2. Ability to type in new words and add them to the list.
  3. Ability to paste in a document of new words and add them 
     to the list.
  4. Ability to load a text document file of new words and add 
     them to the list.
  5. Ability to Add words to the list of known words.
  6. You also choose whether to ignore words that contain numbers, 
     ignore numbers, and strip out all non-alphabetic characters)
     when scanning the temporary work area for words.
     (See "Adding Words to the List of Known Words Options" below).

And, you can do all of this at the click of a mouse button,
within a nice easy to use graphical interface.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Words Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion will **NOT** 
run under Windows 3.x  (even with Win32 installed) !!


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\words_worth - and run the executable 
file words_worth.EXE.

See the introduction above for the type of searches and 
functionality available in the program.


Adding Words to the List of Known Words Options :
-------------------------------------------------

Everything is lowercase.

In Words Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion,
all words are treated as lowercase words.  So the words
Mike, mike, mIKE, MIKE, mIKe would all be treated as 
and equivalent to mike.

When adding words to the List of Known Words, you can 
choose whether to :

- ignore words that contain numbers  (such as Area51), and,

- ignore numbers (213), and,

- strip out all punctuation (@, #, $, %, etc) when scanning 
  the temporary work area for words.  So, the phrase :

     Chelsea are the "best" $$football$$ team !!

  would be treated like :

     Chelsea are the best football team 

  If this option was unchecked (so punctuation, etc was not 
  stripped out, then "best" would be treated as a new word,
  as would $$football$$ and !!

It is recommended you leave these options checked (i.e. 
activated) to prevent pollution of your word lists.

As with all buttons / functions that change the word lists,
you will be prompted to confirm adding of words before
the program proceeds to add words.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete Words Worth - Crossword and 
Scrabble Companion from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever you installed
    it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !


Why I Wrote this Program :
--------------------------

I love a good game of scrabble, and have done for as 
long as I can remember.  I also enjoy crosswords.  But, 
nothing is more frustrating than not being able to 
find the elusive word you need.

This program was written to help me (and you !) find 
the words we need.

I originally wrote a program of the same name "Words 
Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion" way back in 
1982 for my Apple ][ computer.

This old Apple ][ program did part of what this new 
version does, but it was limited in functionality and 
severely limited in the number of words it could handle.  

Back then, there was no internet - or at least the 
internet was not publicly accessible - so no lists of 
words were publicly available - that I could find 
anyway - so I had to type in words by hand.  

This was painful to say the least, but I persevered 
and the program eventually contained around 850 or so 
words - but that was about the limit that the Apple ][ 
could handle, well it was in AppleSoft BASIC anyway.

I gave the program away to friends and they distributed
it to their friends.  But, this was all long ago now.

Anyway, a few weeks ago, I played scrabble, and I started 
thinking about my old Apple ][ program again, and I 
decided to tackle a user friendly version for Windows.  

I originally wrote this program to pull words and generate 
its word list from my own documents - and enable the user 
to do the same.  

But, this was a little tedious, and it was amazing to see 
how many documents you need to scan to get a few thousand 
unique words.  Also, my documents contained words - 
like program variable names, computer terms, etc - that
I did not necessarily want to appear in the word list.

Anyway, just when I was finishing the program I thought I'd 
do a search on the internet for word lists.  Within a few 
hours, I had downloaded a few big word lists, and eventually 
settled on the YAWL list (see "Words List Data File" below) 
which is now included with this program, and is especially 
suited for scrabble and crossword players.

So, not only is my original program resurrected, but it 
is also infinitely bigger, better, and easier to use than 
ever.

The basic list of 938 words (the default list used by 
this program) was extracted from the disk of my original 
Apple ][ version of Words Worth - Crossword and 
Scrabble Companion - a program that I wrote way back in
1982.  So, the data file spans generations of computers, 
generations of operating systems, and more than 20 years 
of time.  Pretty cool hey !

See my web page for screen shots and a disk image of this 
Apple ][ version of Words Worth - Crossword and Scrabble 
Companion - which you can download and run and use with 
Apple 2 emulators right on your own PC !

I hope you enjoy the program.


Words List Data File :
----------------------

This Words Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion
uses a list of words called Yet Another Word List (YAWL), 
which is a list of 263,533 words especially developed for 
use by Scrabble and Crossword players.  

This list of words was built (mainly from other Public 
Domain lists) by Mendel Cooper, Alan Beale, and others.

This list is made available under the following license :

	The YAWL list, is in the Public Domain.  There 
	are no restrictions on its use or distribution.

and can be downloaded directly from :

	http://personal.riverusers.com/~thegrendel/software.html
	http://chrisheng.hypermart.net/
	http://thor.prohosting.com/~cslheng/

So far, I have added 2 additional words to this list : 
A and I, making 263,535 words.

This list of 263,535 words is included with this Words 
Worth - Crossword and Scrabble Companion.

Of course, I do not claim any rights over this word list.  
As such, it is distributed in unprotected, plain text form.
The word list is included completely free of charge 
with this program.

This basic list of 938 words was extracted from the disk of 
my original Apple ][ version of Words Worth - Crossword and 
Scrabble Companion - a program that I wrote way back in
1982.  So, the data file spans generations of computers, 
generations of operating systems, and more than 20 years 
of time.  Pretty cool hey !

Companion - which you can download and run and use with 
Apple 2 emulators right on your own PC !


Special Thanks to :

Thanks to the authors of YAWL and other word lists -

The Future :
------------

I've got tons of ideas for this program.

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Extend the search capabilities.  In this version of the program : 
  * You can use multiple ? wildcards, but only a single * wildcard.  
  * You cannot mix and match ? and * wildcards in this version 
    of the program.
  These wildcard search options could be expanded and improved 
  in the future.

- Other search methods.

- Searching through previous search results.  i.e. use the previous 
  searches results as a basis for the next search, so you can 
  quickly home in on the words you need.

- Add in the scoring of words (under Scrabble Rules).

- Add in the ability to list only words that score over a certain value.

- Add in ability to accept or reject words based on their scrabble
  word scores.

- Optimise the search code.  e.g. store word lengths in an array
  to save recalculating these.

- Ability to sort words alphabetically or by their scrabble 
  word score in ascending or descending order.

- Storing the program in the Windows Tray Bar - with the clock, 
  etc.

- Include other word lists with the program.  e.g. German words,
  Spanish words, English dictionary words, etc.

- Ability to load other word lists and save word lists to any 
  file.  At the moment, word lists are loaded from and saved to
  the file 'wordlist.dat' which is limiting.

- An "Undo" option to reverse or undo the last adding of words
  to the List of Known Words.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.

Amendment History :
-------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0  25-Jan-2002    First Public Release.
                    (11,547 lines of code / comments.)

1.1  1-Feb-2002     Disaster strikes !!
                    Last night, at about 2:30 AM after a long day at work, 
                    and a long evening of coding, I accidentally overwrote 
                    the only copy of my source code for Words Worth.  So, I 
                    had to virtually start from scratch again.  Bugger !!
                    So, I took the opportunity to improve a few things :
                    - You can now do single '*' asterisk searches.  i.e. 
                      find all words in the given range of sizes specified.
                      (Warning: single '*' asterisk searches are slow !!)
                    - You can now do single '?' question mark searches.  
                      i.e. find all single letter words.
                    - You can copy the list of words found in a search
                      and paste them into your own documents / files.
                    - You can also abort searches which are in progress, and 
                      abort adding words to the list of known words.
                    - The number of words found in a search is also displayed.

                    - Add in a progress bar for adding words.
                    - Add 'A' and 'I' into the YAWL List of Known Words.
                    - Add detection of nude supermodels near client PCs.
                    - Slight improvements to the user interface.
                    - Introduce yet more Anti-Hacker / Anti-Cracker measures.
                    - Remove one of my code libraries that was no longer needed.
                    (10,939 lines of code / comments.)

1.1n 17-Feb-2002    New min-words list version.
                    The shareware version now uses 938 words, which are the exact 
                    same word list my Apple ][ version of the program had in 1982.
                    So, the word list data file now spans generations of computers, 
                    generations of operating systems, and more than 20 years 
                    of time.  Pretty cool hey !
                    (10,939 lines of code / comments.)

1.2  18-Mar-2002    Add in the ability to do Phonetic Searches, so you can now 
                    search for all words that sound more or less like another word.
                    Speed up wildcard searches (where the first letter or letters 
                    is supplied) by 25 times.
                    (19,887 lines of code / comments.)

1.3  1-June-2002    Add in Reset buttons for each search criteria.
                    Add in the ability to exclude words containing certain letters
                    for all searches.  So now, for example, you can find all words
                    that sound like "brain" that don't include the letters "em", etc.
                    (20,666 lines of code / comments.)

1.4   1-Sep-2002    Use-ability enhancements :
                    - When you enter some search criteria and hit <ENTER> the 
                      search automatically proceeds.
                    - After the search is complete, the search criteria are 
                      highlighted and selected to make it easier for the user 
                      to change them and go again.
                    - Change all Search Edit Boxes into Combo Boxes, so that you 
                      can easily check back through and repeat any previous searches.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (24,117 lines of code / comments.)

1.4b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (34,672 lines of code / comments.)

1.4f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.


If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is possibly an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my WEB page - see below.
