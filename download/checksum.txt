Introduction :
--------------

Checksum Calculator for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, 
or similar.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Developed using 16-bit and 32-bit Delphi.
(For more details on the 16-bit and 32-bit versions
see "16 Bit and 32 Bit versions" below).

Checksum Calculator is useful for :

- calculating checksums for various files, to ensure 
  copying / transmission occurs correctly.

- calculating, comparing, and checking checksums for Arcade Game 
  ROMs and the ROMS and EPROMS in various computer equipment.

- calculating, comparing, and checking critical set-up files on 
  a PC to determine if anyone or anything (such as a virus) has 
  changed or tampered with these files.

If you are using Windows 3.x, then please use the 16 bit version
of Checksum Calculator (CHECKSUM.EXE), otherwise, if you are
using Windows 95 / NT, please use the 32-bit version of 
Checksum Calculator (CHECKSUM.EXE in the \32bit\ directory in 
the ZIP file), which has Long File Name support, and support 
for multi-gigabyte File Lists.

Checksum Calculator works in 2 modes :

- Multi-File Mode :
- Command Line Mode :  (by popular demand !!)

These are discussed fully below.

Checksum Calculator for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, 
or similar.  This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed).

If you need a Windows 3.x version of this program, let me know !!


Multi-File Mode :
-----------------

In this mode, you can select single files, groups of files,
whole directories, and ALL files in a directory and all 
its sub-directories to generate Checksums on in a single run.

You can also exclude all files with a certain extension,
or exclude all files in directories you specify.

To make things even easier, you can drag and drop lists of files 
and directories into Checksum Calculator from File Manager, 
Windows Explorer, etc using the Mouse.  (Registered Users Only).

Also, if you have set up a Shortcut to Checksum Calculator
in the "SendTo" directory under Windows, then you can also
select a group of files / directories with Windows Exmplorer,
and then right click on any of them, and then "Sent To" 
Checksum Calculator.  (Registered Users Only).

These file / directory lists can be saved in PROFILE files
for future use, or command line running (see below).

You can also choose the type of Checksum to be calculated.

-	4 HEX Digit byte addition checksums.
-	Full HEX byte addition checksums.
-	Cyclic Redundancy Count Checksums.

Refer to the CHECKSUM.HLP file for full details on what 
these checksums are.

Results of the Checksum calculation can be stored in
special .SAV files, and/or compared against other
saved checksum results.

A special Checksum Comparison report can be generated to
show any mismatches against these previous checksum runs.

See "Files Generated by Checksum Calculator" below for
further information.


Command Line Mode :  (Registered Users Only)  (by popular demand !!)
-------------------

At the moment, the command line parameters are :

	/pro:profile_name.pro			(Mandatory)
	The Profile contains the list of files / dirs you 
	want to generate Checksums on.

	/cmp:other_results_file.sav		(Mandatory)
	The file containing a pre-calculated list of Checksum
	Results against which the newly calculated Checksums
	will be compared.

	/savchk:checksum_results_file.sav  	(Optional)
	Where the results of the newly calculated checksum
	results are saved.
	If this parameter is not supplied, the checksum
	results will NOT be saved.
	You can specify the same file as the /cmp: parameter
	but, this would mean that all checksums match every time.

	/savcmp:compare_file.cmp		(Mandatory)
	Where the results of the checksum comparison are saved.
	If the checksums of all files match perfectly, 
	then this file will not exist - unless the 
	"/writeallmatch" flag (see below) is used.

	/chk:check_sum_algorithm_name		(Optional)
	The options here are : 
	4dig	4 HEX Digit byte addition checksums.
	full	Full HEX byte addition checksums.
	crc	Cyclic Redundancy Count Checksums.
	If the user doesn't specify a Checksum algorithm to use, 
	then whatever was they used last-time is used again.

	/autoclose:nn				(Optional)
        If this paremeter is supplied by the user, then Checksum 
	Calculator will automatically shutdown even if there 
	are mismatches in the calculated checksums.
	You can also specify a number of seconds that Checksum will keep
	the Comparison file open for before closing / exiting.
	e.g.	/autoclose	will shut the window down immediately.
		/autoclose:0	will shut the window down immediately.
		/autoclose:3	will keep the window open for 3 seconds.
	If this parameter isn't on the command line, then 
	Checksum Calculator will show a window to the user with
	all mismatches (if any), and wait for the user to click OK.

	/writeallmatch				(Optional)
	Normally if all compared Checksums match perfectly, no
	Checksum Comparison Results Save File is produced, in fact
	Checksum Calculator goes out of its way to ensure none
	even exists.  (See the "/savcmp:" parameter above).  
	However, if this /writeallmatch command line param is 
	used, then the "All Files / Dirs Match perfectly" is 
	written to file.

	/ignorenewfiles				(Optional)
	This parameter specifies that all new files are excluded
	from the checksum comparison results.  This means that
	only files whose checksums mismatch will be listed.
	If this parameter is not supplied, it is assumed that
	new files should be listed on the results screen 
	(i.e. NOT ingored), regardless of what the
	"Ignore New Files in Checksum Comparison Results"
	on what the Settings / Options screen is set to.


Examples of Command Line use :

  CHECKSUM.EXE /pro:c:\11\delphi\11.pro /cmp:c:\11\delphi\11.sav /savchk:c:\11\delphi\11_new.sav /savcmp:c:\11\delphi\11.cmp /ignorenewfiles /autoclose /chk:crc /writeallmatch


A command line could be setup / run from a DOS Batch file 
(provided Windows is loaded), the DOS command prompt (provided
Windows is loaded), from the Icon Properties (Windows 3.1),
or from the Shortcut Properties (Windows 95).

The order of these parameters on the command line does 
not matter.

Validation / verification of the parameters is performed
by Checksum Calculator.

If a Profile is supplied only, then load it, and calculate checksums.

If a Profile and a Comparison File are supplied only, then load 
the profile, calculate checksums and compare checksum results.

If a Profile, a Comparison File, and a Checksum Comparison 
Results Save File are supplied, then load the profile, 
calculate checksums, and compare checksum results, and save them.

The "Autoclose" has no effect unless all a Profile, a 
Comparison File, and a Checksum Comparison Results Save File 
are all supplied !


Files Generated by Checksum Calculator :  { Multi-File Mode ONLY ! }
----------------------------------------

Profiles (.PRO)
	These files are simply a user-defined list of files and directories
	which the user wishes to calculate checksums for.

	These profiles enable you to use the same list of files / directories
	in a future checksum run.

	For example, a single profile could contain :
	    c:\autoexec.bat
	    c:\config.sys
	    c:\network\config\*.*  { All files in dir }
	    c:\windows\*.ini       { all INI files in dir }
	    etc

Checksum Result Files (.SAV)
	These files contain the file name, file path, and checksum for
	each and every file in the user's (above) Profile.

Checksum Comparison Files (.CMP)
	These files contain the results of comparing the checksum 
	results for a group of files with a previous run on the 
	same files.  i.e. the results of comparing 2 .SAV files.


16 Bit and 32 Bit versions :
----------------------------

The 16 bit version is for PC's running Windows 3.x.

The 32 bit version is for PCs running Windows 95, NT, or later.

The 16 bit (Windows 3.x) version is no longer produced or 
distributed by default - however, if you require this version,
email me and I'll see what I can do.

Apart from Long File names (which are wonderful !), the 32-bit 
version is much faster, and also introduces larger file lists.  
But, hang on a second, what the hell does that mean ?

Well, for the 16-bit version, there is a 64 KB file list 
size limit (2 to the power of 16 is 65,536 bytes).  So the 
total size of the list that contains all path + file name 
details for all files to be processed cannot exceed 64 KB.  
So, if the average path + file name length for your files 
is 20 characters, then you can only process around 3,200 
files.  I have run the 16-bit version with over 6,000 files
in various directories.  Not a bad limit !

But, for the 32-bit version, this list size limit is extended 
to 1.5 GB !  But, we also have long file names, so the average 
file name + path length may be 40 charcters.  Even so, the 
number of files limit is extended to over 40 million files !!
This is a limit most users will not easily reach !!


Speed Comparisons - 16 / 32 and CRC / Checksum :
------------------------------------------------

					32 Bit		16 Bit
	CRC's			1500 KB/Sec	650 KB/Sec
	Byte Add Checksum	1250 KB/Sec	655 KB/Sec

The above results are based on repeated benchmarks of 502 Files,
totalling 160 MB on my Pentium 100, 16 MB RAM, Windows 95 PC.

So, the 32 bit version is more than twice as fast as the 16 bit 
version, and, because I have optimised calculations so much,
CRC calculations are now faster than simple Byte Addition 
Checksums.

On my Pentium III 700 MHz PC with 256 MB of RAM and running 
Windows XP, the speed of the program is more than 17 times 
faster than my Pentium 100 Windows 95 PC :

					32 Bit		
	CRC's			26,000+ KB/Sec	

and processes files at around 26 MB / sec.
(Thanks also to my lovely Segate baracude IV, 7200 RPM 
Ultra-ATA4 harddrive).


Running both 16 Bit and 32 Bit versions :
-----------------------------------------

If you are intending to use both 16 bit and 32 bit versions
of Checksum Calculator (which you may choose to do if
you are using both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 / NT or later 
machines) then it is important that you keep seperate Profiles 
and Checksum Results Files for each version.

In the 32 bit version, all file names are long, and the
16 bit version will have serious trouble with these - 
as Checksum Calculator cannot construct a short file name
from a long one.

Also, in the 16 bit version, all file names are short, and 
the 32 bit version will have serious trouble with these,
as Checksum Calculator cannot construct a long file name
from a short one.

So, it is best to keep the Profiles, Checksum Results Files,
etc well and truly seperate for the 16 and 32 bit versions.

e.g. For the 16 bit version you might gave a profile
called "chklst.pro" and for the 32 bit version, you
might have a profile called "chklst32.pro" or (even
better) "check_list_32.pro".


Checksums and CRCs :
--------------------

If you would like further information on CRCs and Checksums
please refer to the CHECKSUM.HLP file for full details.


Limitations / Restrictions of the Shareware version :
-----------------------------------------------------

The Shareware version of this program has the following
limitations / restrictions :

- The program will not save its settings on Windows Shutdown,
  but it will still save its settings when you manually exit / 
  close the program - just not when Windows terminates the program.
- A "Shareware" label is displayed in the Menu area of Text Buttons.
- Every now and then a "You have used this program xxx times, 
  Please Register" message will appear on program startup.
- Start Minimised if set in Shortcut / PIF settings is NOT available.
- Command Line Mode is NOT available.
- "Exclude ALL Files with Extension" functionality is NOT available.
- "Exclude Directory" functionality is NOT available.
- "Add Dir and All Sub-Directories" functionality is NOT available.
- "Copy to Clipboard" functionality on all screens is NOT available.
- CRC 16 checksums are NOT available.
- CRC 32 checksums are NOT available.
- Expert Mode is not available.  Expert Mode changes Checksum
  Calculator so that it does not prompt you to save profiles, 
  comparison results, etc.  If you don't save, then it doesn't 
  nag you.
- Drag and Drop Files / Directories from File Manager (Win 3.x) or
  Windows Explorer (Win 95) into Checksum Calculator's main window
  is NOT available to non-registered users.
- Drag and Drop Files / Directories from File Manager (Win 3.x) or
  Windows Explorer (Win 95) into Checksum Calculator's main window
  is NOT available to non-registered users.

To remove all the limitations of the shareware version,
please Register.


The Future :
-------------

Future changes to this program may include :

- Add in option to show which files have been deleted
  when compared to the another set of checksum results.
  (Started work on this .... ).

- Add in support for Motorola 'S' format & Intel Hex 
  format files.  (Does anyone need this ??)

- Background calculation of Checksums, multi-threaded execution, 
  and other changes to enhance the speed of calculation of checksums.

- Add in a "Construct Command Line" button, so you choose the 
  Profiles, Checksum Save Files, etc, etc with a mouse and it 
  builds the required command line for you and displays it in 
  a Window so you can copy & paste it for use.

- Add in an "Exclude File Spec" button, so that you can exclude all
  files that satisfy back*.doc or some other wildcarded file spec.

- Add in functionality to enable the user to change the File
  Read Buffer size, as different sizes work better on different
  machines with different CPUs, RAM sizes, disk subsystems, etc.

- Anything else ?  Email me and let me know !!

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.


Special Thanks to :
-------------------

I would especially like to thank the following people :

- Jim Knight of FORD Motor Co USA, who gave me loads of
  support and ideas, and kept pushing me through all 
  those all night programming sessions to keep improving 
  this program.  Jim's influence and support was particularly 
  high for versions v2.0, v2.1, v2.2, and v2.3.
  Thanks Jim and Ford USA for supporting my Shareware !!!

- Ross N. Williams <ross@guest.adelaide.edu.au> of
  Rocksoft^tm Pty Ltd for maintaining the FAQ :
  "A PAINLESS GUIDE TO CRC ERROR DETECTION ALGORITHMS".
  Downloadable from :  ftp://ftp.adelaide.edu.au/pub/rocksoft/
  While this document was helpful to some extent, it 
  contained lots of hideous looking C code (which I don't 
  use), and, even though I have a mathematics degree, I
  found a lot of the information hard to understand.

2.2   23-Jun-1997   TEST RELEASE ONLY !
                    Massive changes for this release !!
                    Add in "Exclude ALL Files with Extension"
                    functionality.  (Registered Users only).
                    Add in and "Exclude Directory" functionality.
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Add in a 32-bit version of CheckSum Calculator
                    for Windows 95 / NT which supports Long File 
                    Names and bigger file lists.
                    Fix a problem with the 32 bit version which was
                    causing "Adress FFFFFFFF" errors when run in 
                    command line mode.  (This was actually caused
                    by a bug in DeleteFile in Delphi).
                    Fix the code that removed leading zeroes from 
                    checksums when the checksum was 0.  (This was 
                    causing Address FFFFFFFF errors as well).
                    Add in command line options to enable selection
                    of the Checksum algorithm to be used, and to
                    automatically close the program even if all file
                    checksums do not match.
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Fix a bug in the 16 bit version where "c:\\*.*"
                    was added to the list instead of "c:\*.*",
                    if you added the root directory to the profile.
                    Add in a nice WinHelp format Glossary of Terms.
                    Add in the ability to use CRC Checksums (via
                    the settings screen and command line).
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Add in "Add Dir and All Sub-Directories" button.
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Make the Cancel button on Add Files / Directories
                    buttons work correctly.
                    Rewrite code that relied on BIVBX11.DLL
                    BIGAUGE.VBX so that these are no longer needed.  
                    This reduced ZIP file size by nearly 40 KB.

2.3   26-Jun-1997   Fix a bug in the 32 bit version where file lists
                    were being truncated at 39 KB - this is another
                    bug in Delphi v2 so change over to Listboxes 
                    instead of Memo fields - which are faster anyway.
                    Sort the files, Exclusions, etc in the main
                    window to make them easier to find.
                    Remove a file called '..' that was appearing for
                    "Directory and All Sub Directory" runs.
                    Disable the TABs (Single File, Multi File, and
                    Settings) in the main window while calculating
                    checksums - so that the user cannot change
                    checksum algorithms, etc half way through.
                    Make some changes to enable the 16-bit version to
                    process slightly more files.  i.e. bigger lists.
                    Fix an error in Command Line mode where saving 
                    of checksum comparison results was not occuring.
                    Fix bug in CRC calculation where the calculation
                    was exiting before End-of-File.
                    Display time taken, KB of files processed, and
                    KB/Sec information on Checksum Results screen.
                    Display File yyy of nnn while calculating checksums.
                    Set optimum File Read Buffer size to 8 KB.
                    Make sure user is prompted to save changed
                    profiles on exit - for *any* changes.
                    In the Main Screen, users can now click on
                    items in the Profile to delete them.
                    Add in a "Special Thanks To" section to this file.
                    Add in a "16 Bit and 32 Bit versions" section

2.4   27-Jun-1997   Change the way the Command Line params work
                    to make them a bit more logical.
                    If a Profile is supplied only, then load it,
                    and calculate checksums.
                    If a Profile and a Comparison File are supplied
                    only, then load the profile, calculate checksums 
                    and compare checksum results.
                    If a Profile, a Comparison File, and a Checksum
                    comparison Results Save File are supplied,
                    then load the profile, calculate checksums, and 
                    compare checksum results, and save them.
                    Remove old "Single File Mode" - it was redundant -
                    "Multi-File Mode" is so powerful and easy to use.
                    Don't allow the user to abort checksum calculations
                    or Exit the program during checksum calculations.
                    Prompt the user to save Profile changes if they
                    attempt to exit the program using Window's Close 
                    via the window icon or the application system menu.
                    Add in "Copy to Clipboard" buttons on all screens.
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Prompt user to save an old profile before loading
                    a new profile.  Add in suitable prompts and 
                    messages for list resetting, calculating checksums 
                    on empty profiles, etc.
                    Display suitable messages when supplied files 
                    in the command line parameters don't exist.
                    On the Checksum Profile (Main Window), you can 
                    click on individual lines in the main window to 
                    remove them from the profile.
                    Make sure that the Checksum Comparison Results 
                    Save File does not exist after a run and that 
                    the comparison results are not saved if all files
                    match percectly in command line running.
                    Full formal testing against a detailed written
                    testplan was conducted for this release !
                    (6,315 lines of code)

2.5   28-Jun-1997   If the user presses "Reset List" and cancels 
                    then make sure that the 'unsaved' status of 
                    a changed profile is still intact.
                    Add in a "Running both 16 Bit and 32 Bit 
                    versions" section to this file.
                    Fixed a bizare error in the 16 bit version,
                    where GPF's and OhHide / OnShow errors were
                    popping up when running command line mode.
                    I traced the code for hours, and could find no
                    cause for the errors, but when I changed the read 
                    buffer from 8 KB to 4 KB, all errors went away !!
                    When I changed the buffer back to 8 KB the errors
                    occured again - very repeatable !  VERY Bizare !!
                    I must confess to having no idea why this error 
                    was occuring or why a 4 KB buffer fixed it.
                    But, the errors are not occuring now.
                    Remove unused performance profiling code and
                    checking / degugging code for CRC calculations.
                    Pull a few teeth out of the "Add Directory" and
                    "Add Dir and All Sub-Dirs" buttons so that it allows 
                    you to add parents of already entered dirs.
                    Extend the "/autoclose" command line parameter so
                    that you can also specify a number of seconds
                    to hold the comparison window open for before 
                    closing / exiting Checksum Calculator.
                    Implement a new command line parameter "/writeallmatch", 
                    which will write out "All Files Match perfectly" to the 
                    comparison save file if all checksums match perfectly.
                    (Normally, nothing is written if all match perfectly).
                    (5,862 lines of code)

2.6   03-July-1997  Rename the command line parameter "/sav" to 
                    "/savcmp".  This parameter points to where the
                    results of the checksum comparison are saved.
                    Add in a new command line parameter "/savchk"
                    which indicates where the results of the newly 
                    calculated checksum results are saved.
                    Add in a new command line parameter 
                    "/ignorenewfiles" and a new Settings screen option
                    "Ignore New Files in Checksum Comparison Results"
                    which both enable users to ignore new files
                    on the Checksum Comparison Results screen.
                    Label command line parameters are "Optional"
                    or "Mandatory" in the above documentation.
                    (5,926 lines of code and comments)

2.7   09-July-1997  Fix bug in 16-bit version where files in 
                    exluded directories could still be checksummed.
                    Full formal testing against a detailed written
                    testplan was completed successfully for this 
                    release !

2.8   11-Jan-1998   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (6,080 lines of code.)

3.1   11-Mar-1999   Add in the ability to calculate 32 bit CRCs.
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Add in Expert Mode - which does not prompt 
                    you to save profiles, comparison results, 
                    confirm Profile Reset, etc.  If you don't 
                    save, then it doesn't nag you.
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Add in the ability to Drag and Drop Files and
                    Directories from Windows Explorer / File Manager 
                    onto the main Checksum Calculator Window.
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Add in code to remember the Dir of the files 
                    you last checksummed.
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Add in "Limitations / Restrictions of the 
                    Shareware version" section into this text file.
                    (7,212 lines of code.)

3.2   19-Aug-1999   Add in the ability to use "Send To", as follows :
                    If you have set up a Shortcut to Checksum 
                    Calculator in the "SendTo" directory under 
                    Windows, then you can also select a group of 
                    files / directories with Windows Exmplorer,
                    and then right click on any of them, and then 
                    "Send To" Checksum Calculator.  
                    (Registered Users Only).
                    Work around another bug in Borland Delphi 
                    to fix NTDLL.DLL errors on closedown which 
                    occured on some Windows NT configurations.
                    Enhance "About ..." window with buttons to
                    copy my email and WEB page address to the
                    Window's clipboard, so user can simply
                    paste them into WEB Browser or Email program.
                    (7,493 lines of code.)

3.3   24-Aug-1999   Fix "About ..." dialog's free resources %
                    in Windows NT.
                    Enhance "About ..." window with buttons to
                    copy my email and WEB page address to the
                    Window's clipboard, so user can simply
                    paste them into WEB Browser or Email program.
                    (7,561 lines of code.)

3.4   20-Apr-2000   Add in support for PKZIP, MAME, etc Checksums
                    (CRC 16's / 32's).
                    Store the INI settings file in the program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    (9,170 lines of code / comments.)

3.5   23-May-2000   Work around a bug in the 32 bit version of the program 
                    (Delphi v5.0) which returns an End-of-File (EOF) character 
                    for every single read operation after an EOF file has been 
                    encountered, even when there is more (non-EOF) data in the 
                    file.  (Binary files may contain multiple where EOF characters 
                    - anywhere in the file).  To fix this, I changed over to Memory
                    Streams to process the files, but this had problems with files
                    larger than 64 KB in 16 bit version of the program (Delphi v1.0).
                    So, I then moved to yet another file method, which works fine.
                    (Big thanks to A. Commer (NeXuS) for reporting this error !).
                    Greatlt streamlined / unified code so that all 16 and 32 bit CRC & 
                    Byte Addition Checksum methods are now in a single function.
                    Ensure that 16 bit and 32 bit versions of the program generate 
                    identical results.  WinZIP/MAME compatible CRCs are now only 
                    available with 32 bit Checksums.  Also, save the file list auto-
                    matically on exit, if the user doesn't save the Profile (File List).
                    Display the Checksum Type / Description on the Results Screen.
                    (9,824 lines of code / comments.)

4.0  17-Apr-2001    Massive changes for this release.
                    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" -
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically -
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right,
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu ->
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    Fix handling of null / empty files.
                    Add Restore Factory Defaults, Always on Top, and 
                    Auto-Run at Windows Startup options to the File menu.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Brand New About Screen and associated functionality.
                    Add in *partial* support for the Maximise icon in the 
                    top right corner of the program's main window.
                    Make the program reside in the Windows Tray Bar
                    with the clock, etc.
                    Make WinZIP compatible CRC 32's the new default.
                    Leave the Exit button enabled always - so you can exit 
                    during Checksum Calculations or if there are any problems.
                    You can exit at any time now.
                    Add in a "Halt Processing" button - you can now halt the
                    processing of files and calculations of checksums.
                    This program is now for 32 bit Windows or later.  
                    e.g. Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, or later.
                    i.e. Windows 3.x is no longer supported.
                    However, if you need a Windows 3.x version of this 
                    program, let me know !!
                    (16,900 lines of code / comments).

4.1  5-Feb-2002     Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Introduce yet more Anti-Hacker / Anti-Cracker measures.
                    (18,493 lines of code / comments.)

4.2  23-Oct-2002    Add in "Automatically Save / Load File Lists" option.
                    Allow the user to exit the program during a checksum calculation.
                    (The user is warned first, and prompted to confirm their exit).
                    Fix the checksumming of large files - you can now checksum
                    files of any size regardless of the amount of free memory
                    your PC has.  (Thanks Valdemar for reminding me about this issue).
                    Add in an extra progress bar for the progress in checksumming 
                    each file.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (40,885 lines of code / comments.)

5.0f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.

If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is possibly an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my WEB page - see below.
