Program Registration Cost :	
---------------------------

Prices range from $5 (Five Dollars Australian) per program per user !!

Site Licence / Group Buy / Bulk Buy / Multi-buy Registrations 
are available at massively discounted rates.

Please complete the Registration Form below.

As one of my treasured Registered Users, you will receive :
- FREE upgrades for life (except for Overhead Cable Sag Calculator)
- FREE Technical Support via Email.
- Access to the latest functionality - only available in 
  Registered versions of the programs.
- Friendly and fast customer support via Email.
- Greater say in future changes / enhancements.
- A great BIG thank you from me !!


Email or Fax or Post the Registration Form :
--------------------------------------------

Please complete the Registration Form (below), and 
EMail it to me at : 

	moose@move.NOSPAM.to.SPAMMENOT
(Remove the "NOSPAM." and ".SPAMMENOT" from my email address to email me).

To maintain security, you should ZIP up your completed Text Based 
Registration Form, with a password.   

A 10 alpha numeric character password including a few numbers on 
a ZIP file would take many decades to crack by brute force methods on 
current computers.  Then, in a seperate Email, you could email me the 
password to UnZIP your registration form. 

In this way, a high degree of security could be achieved, and the various 
packet sniffers on the Net would not detect your credit card details. 

Oh yes, just one more thing ... before you email me the encrypted ZIP file, 
please rename it to something else - like .BMP or .PDF - otherwise, the 
virus checkers on my e-mail server will delete the attachment because they 
cannot scan inside the ZIP file. If the encrypted ZIP file is renamed, 
then the virus scanners will pass it through intact. 

If you do NOT want to EMail your credit card details
over the Internet, then there are other ways to Register,
as follows :
- PayPal your payment in $US to me at :
	moose@move.NOSPAM.to.SPAMMENOT
	(Remove the "NOSPAM." and ".SPAMMENOT" from my email address to email me).
  Please include your email address, the $AUD total, and the 
  program you are registering in your order.
- Fax your completed Registration Form along with your credit
  card details.  Email me for my fax number.
- Fax your completed Registration Form along with your credit
  card details.  Email me for my fax number.
- Post your completed Registration Form along with your credit
  card details.  Email me for my current postal address.
- Post the $5 in cash along with your completed Registration Form.
  Email me for my current postal address.
- Post a cheque for $5 + an additional $5 to cover bank fees (to convert 
  your currency to Australian dollars) along with your completed Registration 
  Form.  Email me for my current postal address.

Refer to any of  my WEB pages (see below) for further information.

Please Note : The latest Registration Form is always kept on my WEB site
(See Below).  

If there are any questions / issues concerning your order, then I will
email you to confirm the order before proceeding or debiting your credit card.
