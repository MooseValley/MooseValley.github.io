Introduction :
--------------

Stay On Top for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, ME, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Stay On Top displays a list of all windows programs (and their 
individual component windows), and allows you to double click 
on one or more to make that window awlays stay on top of all
other windows.

The window you place on top will stay on top until another 
windows is placed on top, and then the previous window 
will be second from the top.

To help you locate a window, you can sort the list of windows
by title or ID (which is really the handle of the window),
using the "Sort by ..." butons provided.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Stay On Top will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply run it and observe double click
on the window you wish to stay on top - it's as easy as that.

To help you locate a window, you can sort the list of windows
by title or ID (which is really the handle of the window),
using the "Sort by ..." butons provided.


Why did I write this program ? Why is this useful ?
---------------------------------------------------

When I purchased my new Pentium III PC, it had a video card that 
I could connect to a VCR, camcorder, etc and watch video / TV 
on my PC.  Watching TV in a window or full screen on my PC was 
great !

But, there was one problem, the program included with my PC's 
video card to enable this (TW Video v1.0, by Techwell Ltd) was an 
incredibly crappy and badly written program - it does not save any 
of its settings on exit, it does not remember the options you chose 
last time it was run, it does not stay on top, etc, etc.

This meant (among other things) that I could not watch TV in a 
Window and have it stay on top, so if I wanted to get on and 
do some work in another program, or play a game or something,
I could not have a TV window visible as well.  This was a real 
pain.

So, as I usually do, I sat down and thought about things and wrote 
this program, and now I can watch TV Full screen or in a window and 
have it on top of all of my other windows.

My Stay On Top program made the TW Video v1.0, by Techwell Ltd 
more usable and user-friendly.

In a similar way, this program can be used to make any other
application's windows stay on top of all other windows - which
is a useful thing to be able to do sometimes.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :
- Remember the title(s) of windows you placed "On Top" the last
  time the program was run, and look for these and automatically 
  make them "On Top" again next time the program is run.
  (This is not easy though, as many programs change their titles
  based on their settings, size, version number, date, time, etc).
- Ability to resize program windows - specially for badly written 
  programs that don't remember their settings last time they were 
  run.
- Show the parent / child relationship between windows.
- Show the Thread Id or other details for each program / window.
- Do extra things.  e.g. make a window the bottom of all 
  other windows, etc - if anyone would like this, let me know.
- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.
