Introduction :
--------------

YahtzeeGUI is a simple dice game that runs under the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM).

YahtzeeGUI is a clone of another Yahtzee game I developed (in Delphi) that
is also on my web site - it uses the same icons, same sound effects (my voice, etc)
but apart from that, this Java version is a complete re-write.

This game will run on ANY operating system that is capable of
running the JVM, including desktops, laptops, and tablets running
Windows, Linux, Unix, etc, such as PCs, Macs, Raspberry PI, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company,
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.


Using this Program :
--------------------

Download and install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for
your machine / OS (if it is not already installed on your machine):

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Extract the contents of the YahtzeeGUI.zip file you
downloaded from my web site to a folder on your machine.

And then, double click on:

	YahtzeeGUI.jar

icon / file to run the game in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Now, you are ready to play Yahtzee.  :)

See "Yahtzee Rules" below for details of how play Yahtzee in general.

To start a new game of Yahtzee, click the "Start Game" button,
and the dice will automatically be rolled.  You can discard any
unwanted dice (by clicking on them) and re-roll the dice
(by clicking the "Roll Dice" button) up to 2 times, select a scoring
category by clicking a button (such as "Ones", "Twos", ....
"3 of a Kind", etc), and then click the "Roll Dice" button to
start your next turn.

To see what the current roll of the dice would score in each available
category, simply look at the numbers next to each score box.
(Provided you have "Show Potential Scores in each category"
turned on / checked - see below).

When all scoring categories are filled, the game is over.

Click the "Start Game" button to start a new game.

To help you work with dice, various little buttons are provided
near the dice (provided you have "Show Dice Invert, Off, On buttons"
turned on / checked - see below).  These buttons are as follows :

 - Invert button turns reverses the selection of the dice.
   i.e. all dice selected for re-roll and now kept, and all dice that
   were kept are marked for re-roll.

 - Off button - turns all dice off.  i.e. it selects them all for re-roll.

 - On button - turns all dice on.  i.e. it keeps all dice - none are selected
   for re-roll.

These buttons are provided:
* High Scores: display a top 100 high scrores table (if any).
* Start: start a new game.
* Roll: roll or re-roll dice.
* Help: display a help / about screen.
* Exit: exit and close the YahtzeeGUI program.


Yahtzee Rules :
---------------

Each game of Yahtzee consists of 13 rounds.

In each round, you roll the five dice (and you can also re-roll any or
all of the dice up to twice more) and then you score the dice in one of the
13 scoring categories.

For each game, you must score once and only once in each scoring category.
This means that towards the end of the game you may have to settle for
scoring zero or a low score in some scoring categories.

The score is determined by the dice that you have rolled and by the
category that you have scored it in :

- Ones           : the sum of all dice with a face value of 1
                   e.g.  1,1,2,4,6 would score 2 points if scored in the "Ones" category.
- Twos           : the sum of all dice with a face value of 2
                   e.g.  2,2,2,4,6 would score 6 points if scored in the "Twos" category.
- Threes         : the sum of all dice with a face value of 3
- Fours          : the sum of all dice with a face value of 4
- Fives          : the sum of all dice with a face value of 5
- Sixes          : the sum of all dice with a face value of 6

- 3 of a Kind    : The sum of all dice, provided you have 3 or more of one of the dice.
                   e.g. 1,4,5,5,5 would score 20 points.

- 4 of a Kind    : The sum of all dice, provided you have 4 or more of one of the dice.
                   e.g. 1,1,1,1,5 would score 9 points, and 1,5,5,5,5 would score 21 points.

- Small Straight : 30 points (4 consecutive numbers).  e.g. 1,2,3,4,6 or 1,2,2,3,4.

- Large Straight : 40 points (5 consecutive numbers).  e.g. 1,2,3,4,5 or 2,3,4,5,6.

- Full House     : 25 points. A Full House is 3 of a Kind AND a Pair.  e.g. 3,3,3,5,5.

- Chance         : The sum of all dice.  e.g. 1,3,3,5,6 would score 18 points.

- Yahtzee (5 of a Kind) : 50 points

You also get a bonus of 35 points, if the total of all the dice in the
Ones to Sixes scoring categories is greater than or equal to 63 points.

Prior to computer versions of Yahtzee, physical dice were rolled, people added
up the dice in their head, and scoring was done on paper.

Computer versions of Yahtzee, such as my program, mean that you can enjoy Yahtzee
without having all of this hassle.

In addition, my program enforces the Yahtzee rules, sorts the dice, maintains
high scores, and provides many other features and options to improve the game-play
experience.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- R to roll / re-roll dice.

- An Applet version for running in a web browser.

- Support for various versions of Yahtzee - such as
  "Multi-Yahtzee".  e.g. 50 for the first Yahtzee, and
  100 points for each subsequent one.

- Support for multiple human players in a single game.

- Support for human Vs computer play.

- More / better sound effects.

- Yoda Yahtzee (I can do a great Yoda impersonation).

- Levels, challenge levels, etc.

- Different modes of play, 2 or more Players, etc.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.
