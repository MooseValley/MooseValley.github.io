Loan Analyser v1.4 (Jan, 1989) for DOS.            by Moose O'Malley

FREE Ware !

The program is a Loan Analyser.  You enter the Loan Principal,
the Loan Interest Rate, the Loan Payments Per Year (eg. 52, 26, 12), 
the Loan Repayment Per Period, and an output Report File Name.

The program then writes the Repayment Analysis report to
the file name you specify, and this report contains a detailed
analysis of the cummulative interest, principal repayed, and all
details of the loan on a period by period basis for the life
on the loan.

This version of Loan Analyser is FREE Ware, and you can
copy, distribute, and use it freely as long as this
message remains intact.

The program operates in character mode only.  i.e. it is not a graphical
program, so it will work on any monitor : CGA, EGA, VGA, etc, and 
will run on any PC (with an Intel CPU from 8088 to Pentium Pro), 
and with any amount of memory (it only needs a few dozen KB).

It runs on my 8086 640 KB CGA laptop, and it runs (at the same speed) 
on my Pentium 100 / 16 MB / SVGA.

It also runs under Windows 3.1, 95, NT, but as a DOS application.

This program was written in Turbo Pascal v3 / v5 (DOS).

It may encourage me to develop it further !!
