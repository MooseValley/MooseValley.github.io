Introduction :
--------------

Text Buttons for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, or 
later.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Text Buttons enables you to place often used chunks / sections 
of text behind buttons so that it is very easily and 
quickly obtainable when required.

This program enables you to store text for anything up to
750 buttons in 50 in columns / groups of 15.

How many times have you had to load up a document just to cut
the same piece of text out over and over again ?

How many times have you cursed Microsoft Exchange or other email 
programs because they doesn't handle EMail SIGs properly or put 
your SIGs where you want them ?

Text Buttons is a great way to solve these and other headaches !

Text Buttons can also be used as a notebook to keep frequently
used information - such as Task Lists and To Do Lists - even 
if this information is not often required for copying and
pasting.

I use this program all day every day - for holding email sigs,
to standard emails, to various WEB site addresses, standard
registration letters (for my shareware), lists of registered 
users by program, newsgroups, mailing lists, email addresses,
and various details and notes I need all the time at work and at home.

Why this program hasn't sold millions or even dozens of copies 
around the world, I just can't understand.

You may ask "Why the hell would anyone need dozens, hundreds, 
or the 750 buttons that this program supports ?".  Well, 
start using this program, and pretty soon, you'll hopefully 
discover how darn useful it is, and you'll start using more and 
more buttons, and wonder how you ever got along without 
Text Buttons.

I love this program, and hope you do to !!  :)  I personally 
use well over 100 buttons - and use the program all day at 
work.  (This was why I originally wrote the program).

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Text Buttons for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, or 
later.  This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\text_buttons\ - and run the 
executable file : Textbut.EXE.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu 
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Using Text Buttons :
--------------------

To use Text Buttons, simply click on one of the ten buttons, and 
one of 2 things will happen :

- If the button is already setup, then the text it contains
  will be automatically copied to the Windows Clipboard - ready 
  for use.  You can then paste it into whatever application you 
  are using.  e.g. Email, Word processor, etc

- Or, if the button is not already defined, you will be taken to
  a setup screen where you will be able to define the button's
  label and contents.

- To Add, Change or Erase the definition of a button, simply 
  click with the right mouse button on a particular Text Button
  to enter the Settings Screen for that button.

- If you select "Button Drag / Move Mode" {under the File menu}
  then you will be able to Drag and Drop Text Buttons on to
  each other to change the order / positions / group of
  the buttons.  You will need to select this option again
  under the File menu to turn "Button Drag / Move Mode" OFF
  before Text Buttons are active / usable again.

- On the Text Button setup screen there are buttons for 
  copying text from the clipboard and loading text from 
  a file when defining a Text Button.

You can view 1, 2, 3, or 4 columns of buttons at ant time, and 
you can move backwards and forwards through other groups / columns 
of buttons as desired.

Each group / column of 15 buttons can be assigned a name,
which makes it great for ordering and classifying your 
buttons.

To navigate quickly to other button groups, you can double click
on any group name, or use the "Jump to Button Group" menu option
on the File menu.

You can also select the Font / Size for the text on the buttons.  
For this, you can use any Windows fonts !
(See "Change Button Font" under the File menu).

You can also select the Colour of the text on the buttons.  
For this, you can can use any Windows colours !!
(See "Change Button Font Colour" under the File menu).

This program enables you to store text for anything up to
750 buttons in 50 columns / groups of 15.

If the "Auto-Minimise after Button Press" (under the File menu) 
is checked, then Text Buttons will auto-minimise itself once a 
button is pressed - to get it out of the way so you can 
continue working straight away.

To erase buttons quickly, you can use the "Erase Button Mode" 
menu option (under the File menu), which allows you to erase 
buttons simply by clicking on them with the mouse.

This program is fully scalable - so if you change the size or
shape of the main Text Buttons window, and all buttons, etc
will resize and scale automatically to fit the new window 
size.

Some useful text processing options are included with the program
- see "Text Menu Options" below.


Text Menu Options :
-------------------

The program's Text menu includes the following options :

- Sort Clipboard Text
  Takes text from Windows' clipboard, sorts it into ascending 
  order, and then places it back on Windows Cluipboard.

- WordWrap Clipboard Text
  Takes text from Windows' clipboard, word wraps it to column 70,
  and then places it back on Windows Cluipboard.

- WordWrap and '>' Prefix Clipboard Text
  Takes text from Windows' clipboard, word wraps it to column 70,
  places a ">" prefix in front of every line, and then places 
  it back on Windows Cluipboard.

- UPPERCASE Clipboard Text
  Takes text from Windows' clipboard, converts it to uppercase,
  and then places it back on Windows Cluipboard.

- Lowercase Clipboard Text
  Takes text from Windows' clipboard, converts it to lowercase,
  and then places it back on Windows Cluipboard.

- Titlecase Clipboard Text
  Takes text from Windows' clipboard, converts it to titlecase,
  and then places it back on Windows Cluipboard.

These options are very useful when dealing when text.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete this program 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Before doing this however :

- If you have selected / enabled the "Auto-Run at Windows 
  Startup" option (under the File menu), then you should 
  ensure that this option is not checked / enabled 
  (which you can easily do by re-selecting the 
  "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" option from under 
  the File menu).

- If you have used any of the "Create Shortcut ..." options 
  under the File menu, then you should use the "Delete All 
  Shortcuts" option under the File menu to remove these from
  your system.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Enable user to select Font and size of text (of the data 
  behind the button, not just the button's name), so that 
  the text will appear correctly if it is pasted into Word 
  or email or some other font aware application.

- Enable the program to link to a file instead of having to enter
  the text into the edit window for each button.  This means that
  files that change will always have their latest definitions
  available in Text Buttons.

- Enable the program to work with other types of data, such as
  pictures, sounds, video, etc.

- Make Text Buttons reside on the Windows 95 / NT tray bar.

- Add in the ability to reorder Button Groups.  (i.e. move
  and reorder entire columns of 15 buttons).

- More buttons - is 750 enough ??  ;)

- Optimise the loading and saving of button details to
  make moving groups faster - only needed for very slow PCs.
  e.g. PC's from the early-mid 1980's.  ;)

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.0   30-Mar-1998   First Public Release.
                    (3,220 lines of code / comments.)

2.1   19-Aug-1999   Ability to Drag and Drop Text Buttons on to
                    each other to change the order / positions of
                    the buttons - via the "Button Drag / Move Mode".
                    Also, if the user presses the Right or Middle 
                    Mouse Buttons over a Text Button, then go into 
                    the setup mode for that button.
                    Add in buttons for copying text from the 
                    clipboard and loading text from a file
                    when defining a Text Button.
                    (Note that the copy to from / to clipboard
                    was always available via the standard
                    Windows Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V key presses - 
                    now the functionality is more visible).
                    (4,663 lines of code / comments.)

3.1   08-Mar-2000   Remove the Show / Hide Button Setup Icons 
                    options - they are no longer needed - simply 
                    right mouse click on a particular Text Button 
                    to enter setup mode for that button.
                    Make Text Button Labels have a strikeout (i.e. line 
                    through them) while Button Drag Mode is enabled, to 
                    reinforce that the buttons are not available until 
                    Button Drag Mode is disabled again.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's 
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    Fix NT Warning on Shutdown on some PCs.
                    Store the INI settings file in Text Button's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    (6,678 lines of code / comments.)

3.2   12-Apr-2000   Added in 5 extra buttons - now there are 15 text buttons.
                    10 buttons simply wasn't enough for this very useful program.
                    Also, simplified some of the code, and saved settings when 
                    exiting button setup mode.
                    (6,501 lines of code / comments.)

3.5   24-Oct-2000   Greatly simplify the code to make it very easy to add extra
                    buttons in the future - the program code will now support 
                    1,000's of buttons if required.  Only save Buttons when 
                    they change - not after every exit.  Reduce Memory
                    footprint - even though this was small and never an issue.
                    Support for up to 4 columns of 15 buttons - so you can have 
                    15, 30, 45, or 60 buttons.  (I use this program all the time, 
                    and I just kept needing more buttons - 60 should be enough 
                    for now !).  Enable the user to change the button font.

4.0   10-Apr-2001   ***  Private BETA Release for Bruce C.  ***
                    Added in support for button groups (each group is a column 
                    of 15 buttons), which you can give your own name.  
                    Now, this program supports up to 750 buttons in 50
                    groups (of 15) - hopefully enough for most people !!  ;))
                    (Provided specially for Bruce C - hope you like it Bruce !)
                    Add in the "Always On Top" menu / functionality.
                    (10,304 lines of code / comments.)

4.1   11-Apr-2001   ***  Private BETA Release for Bruce C.  ***
                    Another busy night of coding ... ;)
                    Enhance the Button Drag Mode dialog, and add a "Don't Show 
  Windows 95, 98    This Again" option.
  NT, 2000 only.    Add in an "Erase Buttons" menu option to enable you to quickly 
                    erase buttons simply by clicking on them with the mouse.
                    Add in an "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" menu option to help
                    the user make this program run automatically at Windows Startup.
                    This saves you creating a shortcut to the program in the Windows
                    StartUp folder !!
                    In addition, if you move the program to a new directory or drive,
                    it will automatically sense that its existing auto-run command
                    needs updating to the program's new location.  Very cool !!
                    Add in a "Jump to Button Group" menu option (under the file menu),  
                    to enable quick navigation to any button group.  You can also 
                    achieve this by double clicking on any button group name in the 
                    main window.  Very handy !!
                    Convert Text Buttons to being 32 bit - so you get long file
                    names in the "Load From File" option when a button is being setup.
                    This means that Text Buttons is now for 32 bit Windows (such as
                    95, 98, NT, 2000), and will no longer run on Windows 3.x.
                    Improve the font handling / support.
                    (Special thanks to Bruce C for the great encouragement and support !)
                    (11,996 lines of code / comments.)

4.2   6-Feb-2002    Back onto Public Releases !!  A great deal (v4.0, v4.1)
                    has happened since the last real release.
                    Add the ability to select the Font / Size for the text on 
                    the buttons.  You can use any Windows fonts !!
                    (See "Change Button Font" under the File menu).
                    Add the ability to select the Colour of the text on 
                    the buttons.  You can use any Windows colours !!
                    (See "Change Button Font Colour" under the File menu).
                    When setting up a button or erasing a button, or moving
                    a button, make it have focus.  i.e. it is selected.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Brand New About Screen and associated functionality.
                    Add in support for the Maximise icon in the top right 
                    corner of the program's main window.
                    Introduce yet more Anti-Hacker / Anti-Cracker measures.
                    (16,216 lines of code / comments.)

4.3  29-Oct-2002    Enable the use of any fonts installed on your PC.
                    i.e. the list of fonts that you cna use are no longer
                    dependant on which printer(s) you have installed
                    or which printer is your default printer.
                    (Thanks to Bruce C for alerting me to this problem). 
                    Add some pictures to the buttons on the setup form.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (37,232 lines of code / comments.)
      
4.3b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (42,699 lines of code / comments.)

4.3c  25-Aug-2003   Fix an error in the Button Drag / Move mode - which was
                    saving buttons with a "BitBtn" prefix instead of "Button"
                    prefix.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (71,588 lines of code / comments.)

5.0   14-Jun-2005   Allow the user to Minimise Application On Start-Up by 
                    providing an option under the File menu.
                    Add in a Text menu with the following options :
                      - Sort Clipboard Text
                      - WordWrap Clipboard Text
                      - WordWrap and '>' Prefix Clipboard Text
                      - UPPERCASE Clipboard Text
                      - Lowercase Clipboard Text
                      - Titlecase Clipboard Text
                    These options are very useful when dealing when text.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (74,708 lines of code / comments.)

If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is most likely an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my Home page and its mirrors.
