Introduction :
--------------

ROM / File Chopper for Windows 95 / 98 / NT / 2000.

ROM / File Chopper allows you to : quickly and easily chop
files in half and throw away the second half.

Why do this ??

If you are an emulation or arcade machine enthusiast, then you 
will know the extremely common problem of double length ROMS
- where the files data is duplicated.  This is mainly due to
reading errors or reading the ROM with the wrong EPROM Reader 
settings.

This program can fix virtually all of the "INCORRECT LENGTH"
errors you see reported by MAME and other emulators - and I
especially wrote it to fix my Neo Geo ROMS, but it works with
any file that needs chopping in half.

I wrote this program in about 30 minutes, and it immediately 
saved me about 12 hours in re-dumping and re-downloading 
problem ROMs.  I hope it saves you similar time / work.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program is FREE software - any person and any company is
welcome to copy it, use it, and distribute it as they see fit,
as long as the distribution ZIP file remains intact - it should 
include 3 files : romchopr.EXE, romchopr.txt, and catalog.txt.

If you find this program useful, please visit my WEB page
and check out some of the other Freeware or $5 dollar shareware
programs I have on offer there. 


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply unzip it to a directory (using 
PKUNIP, WinZIP, or similar), run it.

You can then Drag and Drop files directly onto ROM / File Chopper
via Windows Exmplorer or straight from ZIP files, etc, then
click the chop button, and provided no errors are encountered
then a success message will be displayed.


Hints on Working with ZIP files :
---------------------------------

(This is the easiest and best way to use ROM / File Chopper,
and this is how I use the program).
N.B. This assumes you have WinZIP, PowerZIP, EZIP, or similar 
installed on your PC.

- In MAME, or your emulation program run an audit on your ROMS.
- Double click on the ZIP file for a ROM with audit errors.
- Drag the first problem ROM out of the ZIP file and drop it 
  on ROM / File Chopper.
- Click the Chop button.
- Click on the ZIP program (WinZIP, or whatever), and it will tell 
  you that the file has changed and asks if you would like to
  place the new version of the file back into the ZIP.  Click YES,
  and your ZIP now contains the correct sized ROMs.
- Repeat for any other files in the ZIP that had audit errors.


Freeware Information :
----------------------

This program is FREE software - any person and any company is
welcome to copy it, use it, and distribute it as they see fit,
as long as the CPUFLAW.EXE and this text file remain intact.

If you paid money for this program, then you were ripped off,
and you should complain to the person who sold it to you !!


Limitations / Restrictions of the program :
-------------------------------------------

None.  There is no trial period and there is no "cutdown"
or "restricted" functionality that requires users to register.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Console to MVS dump conversion for Neo Geo ROMs.
  If anyone knows how to do this, please let me know.

- Fix the "Rom needs Redump" roms in MAME.
  Is there some way to fix these roms without having to
  actually pull the roms off your PCB and re-read them.
  If anyone knows about this, please let me know.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, or would like to give me some feedback on the program,
please email me and let me know.


Special Greetings / Thanks to :
-------------------------------

Special thanks to all arcade emulator authors, people who maintain 
arcade emulator sites, and those who dump the roms, with special 
mention to :

- Dave Spicer for developing Sparcade - the very first Arcade Emulator 
  for PCs, which introduced me to Arcade Emulation way back in 1995.
  I was and still am compltely blown away by arcade emulation !!
- Nicola Salmoria (for MAME and other emulators) and the fabulous MAME 
  and MAME 32 Development Teams.
- Neil Bradley (Emu, Retrocade and others).
- Antiriad and the Raine Development Team.
- Dave (Final Burn).
- Anders Nilsson & Janne Korpela (Neo Rage and Tutankham).
- Thierry Lescot (System 16 Emulator).
- Neill Corlett (MGE).
- Michael Cuddy (KEM & Gyruss).
- and all other arcade emulator developers - you guys rule !!!
- Virtu Al, Brian Peek, MAME DK, and others.

Even though some of these emulators are no longer under development,
your amazing work is NOT forgotten !!

                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right,

                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu ->
