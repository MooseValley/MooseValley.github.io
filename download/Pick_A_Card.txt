Introduction :
--------------

Pick A Card is a "for fun" program for Windows 
95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Pick A Card will use cunning, stealth, and advanced
computer hueristics to holistically determine 
which card you selected from a set of cards.

Simply speak the name of the card out loud three times,
and then stare at the card and keep saying its name out 
loud and finally click your mouse on the Animated Moose.

Behind the scenes, the program will then sense and analyse
the vibrations and electromagnetic radiation entering the 
computer via the mouse, keyboard, screen, and subtle
variations in the air to try and determine which card
you chose.

The program is NOT yet 100% accurate, but it should be 
correct in around 98% of cases.

Warning: You may be amazed and stunned by how accurate 
         this program is !!

Please send me feedback on the program to encourage me to 
continue my work on this program.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\card\ - and run the executable 
file : Pick_A_Card.EXE.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu 
in the program.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete Mad Cow Disease 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

Try and improve the accuracy to 100% - however, this will 
require a great deal of research and analysis - but one
day it might be possible ...

Please send me feedback on the program to encourage me to 
continue my work on this program.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.
