Introduction :
--------------

Paper Quiz Generator is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, 
netbooks, etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which 
includes Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Paper Quiz Generator is a program that enables you to generate paper 
based true/false and multiple choice quizes - consisting of a random 
selection of questions and the randomised answers for each question - 
from files of questions and answers that you provide.  Paper Quiz 
Generator is ideally suited for generating the true/false and multiple 
choice (A,B,C,D,E,etc) question sections of paper based exams, 
assignments, tutorial questions, and so on.

Paper Quiz Generator enables you to:
- Select a file containing the Questions and Answers or drag and 
  drop a file from Windows Explorer (see "Question and Answer File Format" 
  below),
- Specify the number of questions to ask (questions are selected at 
  random from the question and answer file),
- Specify various other settings such as:
* Appending an auto-incremented sequence number to output file names so you can 
  generate many question and answer files by just repetitively clicking 
  the "Create" button.
* Whether to include a quick marking summary at the top of each answer file.
This makes it much faster and much easier to mark quiz attempts.
* Whether to show a success message dialog after each quiz is created.
* etc
- You can view / edit the questions and answers file, and the generated 
  quiz questions file and quiz answers file by clicking the "Open" buttons 
  to the right of each file name's data entry box.

Paper Quiz Generator is very easy to use.  A couple of minutes (or less) 
and you will be an expert in using Paper Quiz Generator.

For information about the required question and answer file format, see 
"Question and Answer File Format" below.

A sample Questions and Answer file is included in the ZIP file for this program.
See file called "Moose's Sample Quiz.qiz".

Also, two sample quizes generated from this Questions and Answer file, 
and their corressponding answer files, are included so you can very easily 
see what this program does.  
See files "Moose's Sample Quiz_1_questions.txt" and "Moose's Sample Quiz_1_answers.txt", 
and "Moose's Sample Quiz_2_questions.txt" and "Moose's Sample Quiz_2_answers.txt".


Notes:

(1). This program is only suitable for quizes where all of the 
questions and answers are written in plain text.  It will not and cannot 
display images, sounds, videos, fancy formulas, specially formatted text, 
etc in your quizes, then this program is *not* for you.  
(I might add support for this in the future - see "The Future" below).

(2). The question and answer files for this program are 100% compatible with 
my Quiz Master software.  However, Paper Quiz Generator questions can have 100's  
of possible answers for a question (or even millions, if you want), whereas my 
Quiz Master software has a limit of 5 answers per question (because it has to
display the answer to each question in up to 5 radiobuttons on the screen).

I actually developed this functionality many years ago - way back in the late 
1990's by adapting my Quiz Master program to provide what I needed. 
Over the years, I have generated literally 1,000's of multiple choice quizes
for courses I have taught using the paper quiz generation features I built into
my Quiz Master program.  However, this was a hacked together solution, 
that was disabled and hidden in all released versions of my Quiz Master program
because and it was not polished or suitable for public release.

In February 2015, I dusted off my old code, completely re-wrote it to streamline 
everything and make it super adaptable and re-usable in other projects, extended 
it to handle questions with anything from 1 - 1+ million answers, extracted 
everything to an easily adaptable and re-usable Quiz Engine (behind the scenes) 
and used this Quiz Engine created for my Paper Quiz Generator.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP
file to a directory - such as c:\Paper_Quiz_Generator\ - and run
the executable file Paper_Quiz_Generator.EXE.

To make the user interface more streamlined / compact, all of 
the buttons have just an icon - no words or text in the button.  
However, all buttons have tooltips (little pop-up help bubbles) 
that appear when the mouse pointer hovers over them.

For further information about all of the program's functionality,
see the "Introduction" section above.

For information about the question and answer file format, see 
"Question and Answer File Format" below.


Question and Answer File Format :
----------------------------------

The format of each Questions and Answers file is identical to 
the required by my Quiz Master program.

The following explains the format of the Question and Answer
file.

Comment Lines :

! -  Any lines starting with an exclamation mark (!) are 
!    treated as comments and are ignored.

Each Question must consist of :

Q::  The Question to be asked - all on one line.
A::  A line of answers - all on one line and with each possible 
     answer option seperated by '::'.
     This answer line must immediately follow the question line to 
     which it relates.
     And, the first answer in the list must be the correct one !
     i.e. there can ONLY be 1 correct answer and it must be 1st.
     The answer options are randomised when the quiz is generated,
     otherwise the quiz taker could just answer "A" for everything.
     You can have anything from 1 up to millions of possible 
     answers per question.  Most questions will have between 
     between 2 and 5 answer options - and only of these will be correct.
     
In addition, "QT::: is used to hold the Quiz Title (only one 
per quiz), for example :

QT::General Knowledge Quiz

Example:

!
! Moose's Sample Quiz.
!
QT::Moose's Sample Quiz
!
Q::What is the capital of France ?
A::Paris::Berlin::London::Prague
Q::If 3 Men can move 7 tonnes of gravel in a 8 hours, how long would it take 11 Men to move the same amount of gravel ?
A::3.2 Hours::3.5 Hours::3 Hours::8 Hours
Q::Which Day Is Named After A Planet ?
A::Saturday::Monday::Wednesday::Friday
Q::What Is The Larva Of The Fly Called ?
A::Maggot::Grub::Wiggler::Flyet


And so on - just keep adding questions and answers in the above format.
Each question can have 1 - 1+ million possible answers.
Just make sure the 1st answer on each line is the correct one.
Piece of cake !  :)

The following files are included in the Paper Quiz Generator ZIP file:

* Moose's Sample Quiz.qiz
Sample question and answer file (as per the above sample).


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Import quizes in other formats / from other software.
  Need this ?  Email me and let me know.

- Support various options for formatting the resulting quiz questions 
  and the list of answers:
  For example, some people  may like this format:

    (1). What is the capital of France ?

    (A). London
    (B). Paris
    (C). Prague
    (D). Berlin
    
  while other people may prefer:

     1. What is the capital of France ?  
     A. London
     B. Paris
     C. Prague
     D. Berlin

  Or some other format.  It may seem like a small point, but 
  formatting is important, and schools, universities, etc may 
  have standards that need to be followed for quiz questions.
  It's not much fun re-formatting questions and answers manually.
  So, if you need a specific format - let me know !  :)
  
- Support for non-text items in the quiz, such as images, sounds, 
  videos, fancy formulas, specially formatted text, etc.
  This will require special output files (non-text) - 
  see next item.

- Generate Quiz questions in HTML and/or Javascript so 
  they can be added as interactive quizes to web pages, and 
  so that they can support images, sounds, videos, fancy 
  formulas, specially formatted text, etc.

- An auto-marking / auto-grading functionality to automatically 
  "mark" attempts at each quiz, keep logs of attempts, and so on.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.
