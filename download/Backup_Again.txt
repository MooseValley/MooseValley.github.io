Introduction :
--------------

Backup Again is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 
2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Backup Again is a program that makes backing up your files
a breeze.

More specifically, Backup Again allows you to :
- specify the directories to backup, 
- specify whether you want to backup each directory or each 
  directory and each of their sub-directories,
- specify whether you want to backup all files, or just
  those modified after a certain date,
and then you simply press the "Backup and ZIP" button
and all files are backed-up and compressed into a single 
ZIP file which is automatically named according to the 
current date / time.

With Backup Again, backing up your data need never get 
you down !!

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
---------------------------

I wrote this program because, well, let's face it,
Backing Up your files is a chore.  No-one I know
backs up their files as often as they should.

Even I admit that, and I keep regulkar backups of backups
in many different locations.

However, what would happen if your PC was stolen, or
your harddrive crashed, or your PC suffered a virus 
attack ?

Yes, that's right, all of your years of hard work could
be gone in an instant.

Even if you kept regular monthly or weekly backups, 
you could still end up facing many hours of lost work.

Imagine just losing a day or an hours worth of work ??

When the data is gone, the chances are it is too late 
to do anything about it - unless you have a very recent 
backup.

With Backup Again, backing up your data need never get 
you down !!  ;)

Simply, specify a few settings and click the button
and backup again works out what to backup and does 
the job.

When the process is finished, you could then copy the 
backup ZIP file to a floppy disk, or burn it onto a CD,
or copy it to another harddrive, or back it up of a 
network drive, or email it to yourself at work or home, 
or upload it to a secure web site, etc.

Once you have the Backup ZIP file, you can easily make 
as many copies of it as you like in as many locations 
that are available to you.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\Backup_Again\ - and run the executable 
file : Backup_Again.EXE.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

When the program is running, you can use the buttons provided 
to add or remove data directories, do the backups, etc.

In addition, you can simply drag and drop directories from Windows 
Explorer to add these to the list of directories to backup.

You can also specify where to store the backup ZIP files.

On the "Settings" tab, you can also choose to :

- Backup All files, or just backup files that have been 
  modified since a certain date / time.

- Backup files from just the selected directories, or
  you could backup the files from each selected 
  directories and all of their sub-directories.

- Keep a log file of processing.

Once you are happy with these settings, simply press the
"Backup and ZIP Files" button, and the backup will proceed.
Once completed, you will informed how many files were 
backed up.


File Exists in Multiple Places :
--------------------------------

If you have a file that exists in multiple places,
then these can be a pain to backup manually.

For example, if you had a file with the same name in :

  c:\My Documents\     { Your main harddrive                        }
  d:\My Documents\     { A removable drive you use at work and home }

and that this file had been modified in each location since the 
last backup date / time.

If you were backing up both of these directories at once to the same
ZIP file, then you could have problems - because ZIP files
do not contain the drive where the file came from.  

So, which version of the file is placed in the ZIP file ?

The only way to determine which is the most recent version 
of the file is to compare the last modified dates / times.

And, this is exactly what Backup Again does behind the scenes.

And, this ensures that the latest versions of all files are backed up.

Alternatively, if you want to synchronise all files in multiple 
directories, then you could use my File Synchroniser program.
(Also available on my web page).


ZIP File Settings :
-------------------

The following settings are used when ZIP'ing files :
- Full directory paths are stored for each file
- All files are compressed at Maximum compression.


Backup ZIP File Names :
-----------------------

Backup ZIP file names are automatically allocated by the 
program, depending on the current date / time, and the
settings you specify.

For example, if you choose to backup all files of any age, then
the Backup ZIP file will be called, something like :

	Backup_2003-03-26_12-59.zip

which indicates that the date and time of the backup were 
26-March-2003, at 12:59 PM.  i.e. this is when I pressed
the "Backup and ZIP" button.

N.B. This file name looks strange - especially with a 
     semi-colon ";" separating the hours and minutes, 
     but that is because you cannot use colons ":" 
     in PC file names.

However, if you choose to backup all files modified
after 19-March-2003 at 1:00 AM, then the Backup ZIP 
file will be called, something like :

	Backup_2003-03-19_01-00__to__2003-03-26_12-59.zip

which indicates that it contains all files modified
between the date you specified above and the current 
date and time.  i.e. all files modified 19-March-2003, 
at 1:00 PM, and the date / time that the "Backup and ZIP" 
button was pressed, which in this example is 26-March-2003, 
at 12:59 PM.

So, why did I make the program automatically allocate
the name of the backup ZIP file ??

Well, it ensures that the name is meaningful and clear.

And, it means that if you sort your backups directory
in alphabetical order, that you will see the files
in increasing order of backup date or the last modified 
date of the files the ZIP files contain.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete the program from your 
computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Before doing this however :

- If you have selected / enabled the "Auto-Run at Windows 
  Startup" option (under the File menu), then you should 
  ensure that this option is not checked / enabled 
  (which you can easily do by re-selecting the 
  "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" option from under 
  the File menu).

- If you have used any of the "Create Shortcut ..." options 
  under the File menu, then you should use the "Delete All 
  Shortcuts" option under the File menu to remove these from
  your system.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- More Backup options :
  * the ability to password protect backups,
  * the ability to encrypt backups,
  * the ability to split backup ZIP files into more 
    conveniently sized chunks, instead of having one 
    big ZIP file.
  * the ability to name the Backup ZIP file yourself, instead
    of having the program do it automatically for you.

- Add in the ability to choose your own log file's name, and/or 
  append processing results to existing log files.

- Ability to specify which file types to process.
  e.g. you might like to process Word Documents, and similar files,
  or, you might not want to backup ZIP files or EXE files, etc.

- Command Line Mode - to automate backups from the command line.

- Auto-Backup mode - so that your PC automatically backs up 
  selected directories whenever Windows starts-up and/or 
  shuts-down.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.
