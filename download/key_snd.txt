Introduction :
--------------

Key Sound Generator is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, and similar.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Key Sound Generator is a fun program that plays a particular 
sound effect each time a mouse button or keyboard key is pressed.

Different sounds are played depending on the type of key or button.

	Sound File      Type of Key which Triggers this Sound
	-------------   -------------------------------------
	ARROW.WAV       An arrow key
	BACKSPCE.WAV    The backspace or delete key
	MOUSE.WAV       A mouse button
	RETURN.WAV      The Return key
	SPACEBAR.WAV    The Spacebar
	OTHER.WAV       Some other key on the keyboard.

The following sounds are available:
- Typewriter sound effects,  recorded from my "Brother 300T" 
  portable typewriter.

- Electronic Sounds a Public Domain sounds CD.

- Wind (Thanks to Murray for these disgraceful burping sounds.)

- Arcade (selected sounds from classic arcade games running in MAME)

To change the sound set, simply select a new directory (within 
the program - see below) which contains the new sounds. 

You can record your own sounds and use these within the program.
Just record them (using Windows Sound Recorder or similar) and save
them in a directory and then select this directory to load sounds from.
N.B. Short Sounds work best !

When run, this program's icon will sit in the Windows Tray Bar area,
and monitor your keystokes and mouse clicks and play sounds 
as appropriate.  When you left mouse click on the program's icon in 
the tray bar (or right mouse click and choose the "Restore" option 
in the popup menu), then the program window will appear :
- which enables you to see what sounds are needed,
- enables you to select a new directory which contains alternate sounds,
- and enables you to keep repeating sound while key is pressed / held down
  or else just play bthe sound once no matter how long the key is held down.

The menu options enable you to :
- make the program stay "Always on Top" of other programs.
- Auto-Run the Program when Windows Starts Up.
- Restore Factory Defaults
- and all other functionality that is standard to my programs.
  (About menu, Catalog menu, etc).

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.
This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Why I Wrote This Program :
--------------------------

I wrote this program because I had many requests from
people on the internet for a program like this.

Sure, key sound programs like this already exist, in 
fact, at the request of others, I downloaded 4 key 
sound programs from the internet and reviewed these
before starting work on this program.

All four of these programs were either limited, or you could 
not use your own sounds, or they were deficient in other ways.

In addition, three of the four key sound programs I trialed
costed $15 US Dollars or more.  My program costs $10 Australian 
dollars - which is about $5 US dollars.  i.e. one third of this !

One of the four key sound programs was "free", but this nagged you 
too much and changed your WEB browser's Home page.

Other programs I was told about, click on Ad banners behind the 
scenes, or hide cookies in your machine, or displayed similar 
unacceptable behaviour.

I also found quite a few bugs with some of the key sound programs
I downloaded.  e.g. they didn't play sounds for all keyboard keys.

My program incorporates all of the best features of all of 
these programs, comes complete with multiple sets of sounds,
allows you to use your own sounds, ensures that some sort
of sound is played for every key on the keyboard, and only 
costs a small fraction of these other programs without 
any of the nags or home page changes.



Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

The steps for using the program are :

- Step 1 : Install the program.

  Unzip the program to a directory on your PC.
  Such as:

    C:\Program Files\Key_Snd\

- Step 2 : Run the Program :

  Using Windows Exmplorer, open the directory where you 
  extracted the contents of the ZIP file (in 1. above), and 
  double click on the KEY_SND.EXE file torun the program.

  When you do this, a small icon will appear in the Windows tray bar, 
  talkclckand sounds will be made when you hit *any* key on the keyboard.

If you click on the Key Sound Generator icon in the Windows Tray Bar 
then the program window will apear, and you can then choose from a 
whole range of options, such as :
- Always On Top
- Auto-Run at Windows Startup
- Restore Factory Defaults
- View Readme File
- View Catalog
- About ...  (i.e. about this program).
- Exit (this program).

N.B.  To run this program every time Windows starts up, then
use the "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" option under the File menu.
You only have to select this option once, and from then on, Key 
Sound Generator will automatically run every time Windows starts up.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

Before deleting the program, you should turn off 
the auto-running of this program under Windows - 
if you have previously enabled it.  Simply, run the 
program and re-select the option under the File menu 
to achieve this.

Exit the program - so it is no longer running.

Using Windows Exmplorer, open the directory where you 
extracted the contents of the ZIP file (in 1. above), and 
then, simply delete the directory to where you extracted the
ZIP file.  e.g.  C:\Program Files\Key_Snd\

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program
such as :

- More sound groups.  e.g. a different sound for the function 
  keys, or numeric keypad keys, or TAB, etc.

- More sounds.  In the future, I would like to add additional 
  sounds :
    * Animal noises
    * Farmyard noises
    * any others ?

- Better sound quality.  All sounds at the moment are 8 bit mono,
  to save disk space and make the download from the internet as
  small as possible.  However, 16 bit CD quality stereo sounds
  are much better ... :)

- Anything else ?

If you would like any improvements, or would like to
suggest any improvements, please email me and let me know.

As with all of my shareware programs, how much more work I do on 
this program depends entirely on what support I get, how many 
people use the program, etc.

None of my programs are perfect - I am the first to admit that.
I have ideas for improvements and enhancements for all of my 
shareware.  How much I improve things and when depends on the 
support I receive for my hard work.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0  7-Apr-2001     First Public Release.
                    (8,314 lines of code / comments.)

1.1  6-Feb-2002     Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Introduce yet more Anti-Hacker / Anti-Cracker measures.
                    (10,435 lines of code / comments.)

1.2  21-June-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Make the TAB key use the same sound as the Spacebar.
                    (Until now, the TAB key had no sound allocated to it, and it 
                    made no sound at all).  (Thanks for reporting this Bill !!).
                    (19,519 lines of code / comments.)

1.2b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (29,781 lines of code / comments.)

1.3   22-Apr-2004   Add in the ability to disable or change the sounds played in 
                    each category.  The user could always do this - but only 
                    manually renaming the sound WAV files.  However, now this 
                    functionality is provided directly by the program - 
                    no messy renaming of files is required.
                    In addition, the user can also choose "No Sound" for each 
                    sound category - which is useful if a particular sound is 
                    becoming annoying.  e.g. You might like to turn sound off 
                    for the arrow keys.
                    Add in the ability to restore the default sound settings 
                    for each key / button category.
                    All of these changes were made following some great feedback 
                    and a request by Jonathan H.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (45,256 lines of code / comments.)

1.4  25-June-2004   Fix the playing of sounds which I broke in the previous release - 
                    but the testers somehow failed to notice this.
                    Thanks to David for reporting this to me earlier today.
                    Also, add in buttons to enable the user to play / hear / test 
                    the selected sound in each category.
                    At the end of the installation of Key Sound Generator,
                    when the user presses the "Finish" button, automatically 
                    run Key Sound Generator, so that the user does not have to 
                    find it and execute it manually.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (45,327 lines of code / comments.)
                    
1.4f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.
