Introduction :
--------------

Print and PDF Pictures is a program for Windows 95, 98, 
ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Print and PDF Pictures enables you to drag and drop a whole 
bunch of pictures from Windows Explorer, move or sort these
into the required order, and then either :
- Print them all out to a printer, 
- Or, if you have Adobe Acrobat Distiller installed
  (http://www.adobe.com/), then you can print them all 
  to the Acrobat Distiller, which places all of the 
  images into a PDF (Portable Document Format) file.

At the moment, every image is enlarged to fill the page,
and each image is printed one per page.
(Options to allow you to customise these and other settings 
are planned for the future - see "The Future" below).

At the moment, the program supports ".BMP", ".JPG", 
".JPEG", ".EMF", and ".WMF" graphics file formats.
(Options to allow you to use other graphics file formats
are planned for the future - see "The Future" below).

This program should be useful to anyone who wants to print 
a number of images, or get them into a suitable format that 
enables easy reading "on screen".

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
--------------------------

Lately, I have been busy scanning many of my oldest 
computer magazines and manuals into my computer.
They are getting very old - some are over 20 years old - 
and their condition is deteriorating steadily.  So, I 
decided to scan them in and store them electronically 
before they deteriorate any further.

However, having these scans in individual files means 
that they are difficult to read on screen - you need to 
load each image in, read it, load the next image in, 
read it, etc.

In addition, these images are also very difficult to print.
You need to load the image into a graphics program,
like Paint Shop Pro, print it, load the next image in, print it.

To print a whole magazine's worth of scans would take hours,
and be a frustratingly slow process.

To PDF it is even worse !  The only way I found to do this 
was to manually load all of the images into a Word Processor -
one by one - and reszise each image, add page breaks, etc.
If you had a couple of hundred images to do, this this would 
take several hours and be frustratingly tedious and slow work.

What I needed was a program to print all of my images automatically,
or, better yet, enable me to print them all into a PDF document
so that I could read this on screen.

I did a quick search of the internet, and found very few links 
that looked promising for what I needed to do.

When I followed these up, I found software that didn't do what it 
promised, was extremely difficult to use, and costed a fortune.

Drum roll please ...

Enter Print and PDF Pictures.

So, as I usually do, I decided the only way to get the 
functionality I wanted was to write my own software.  
So, I sat down and wrote this program over the course 
of a couple of nights.

Print and PDF Pictures enables you to drag and drop a whole 
bunch of pictures from Windows Explorer, move or sort these
into the required order, and then either :
- Print them all out to a printer, 
- Or, if you have Adobe Acrobat Distiller installed
  (http://www.adobe.com/), then you can print them all 
  to the Acrobat Distiller, which places all of the 
  images into a PDF (Portable Document Format) file.

At the moment, every image is enlarged to fill the page,
and each image is printed one per page.
(Options to allow you to customise these and other settings 
are planned for the future - see "The Future" below).

At the moment, the program supports ".BMP", ".JPG", 
".JPEG", ".EMF", and ".WMF" graphics file formats.
(Options to allow you to use other graphics file formats
are planned for the future - see "The Future" below).

The program is extremely easy to install and use, and it is 
incredibly inexpensive.

I personally use this program extensively, and 
I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Credits / Thanks :
------------------

None at this stage.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\Print_Pictures\ - and run the executable 
file : Print_Pictures.EXE.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu 
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete this program 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Before doing this however :

- If you have selected / enabled the "Auto-Run at Windows 
  Startup" option (under the File menu), then you should 
  ensure that this option is not checked / enabled 
  (which you can easily do by re-selecting the 
  "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" option from under 
  the File menu).

- If you have used any of the "Create Shortcut ..." options 
  under the File menu, then you should use the "Delete All 
  Shortcuts" option under the File menu to remove these from
  your system.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

There are many things I could do with this program in the 
future, for example :

- Support for more advanced print options.
  e.g. setting margins, maintaining aspect ratio, etc.
  At the moment, every image is enlarged to fill the page,
  and each image is printed one per page.

- Support for more graphics file formats.
  At the moment, the program only supports ".BMP", ".JPG", 
  ".JPEG", ".EMF", and ".WMF" graphics file formats.

- Ability to remove the "Courtesy of ..." message at the 
  bottom of each page.

- Ability to set the print title, document name, etc.

- Ability to output the page number to the bottom or top 
  of each page.

- Anything else ??

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
