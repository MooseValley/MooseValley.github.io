Introduction :
--------------

Storm Distance Calculator for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Storm Distance Calculator enables you to easily log the time 
between Lighting Flashes in a storm and the subsequent 
Thunder Rolls, and automatically :
- calculates the distance that the storm is from you, and,
- determines whether the storm is moving away from or towards 
  you.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

If you find this program useful, please visit my WEB page
and check out some of the Freeware or $5 dollar Shareware
programs I have on offer there. 


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply unzip it to a directory (using 
PKUNIP, WinZIP, or similar), run it, click the "Check for
Pentium Flaw" button and read the message that should
appear pretty well instantanously after this.


Inspiration for this Program :
------------------------------

I was walking my dog, Jessica, on the beach in Yeppoon, 
Australia on Sunday (24-Oct-1999) when I was surrounded 
by a huge storm and rain squall.  There was lightning 
all around us, the thunder was constantly rolling, and 
the rain beat down so that my vision was blurred.  
Jessica was extremely frightened and I was quite 
concerned about us being struck.  

Luckily we weren't.

But I couldn't help wondering how close the lightening 
was to us.  So, when we got home, had a shower, washed 
Jessica, had a hot coffee, and dried off, I wrote this 
program - Storm Distance Calculator.

I now know that the lightning strikes (which were 
happening on-average every second - were less than 
300 metres away from  me in all directions.  The 
storm lasted about 20 minutes.

So, Jessica and I had good cause for concern during 
the storm after all !!  ;)


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :
- Ability to display the storm distance in Miles, Feet, etc.
- Logging of storm information into seperate files.
- Ability to compare storm movement rates and lightning
  strike rates.
- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Use at Your Own Risk :
----------------------

Using your PC near or during an electrical storm is not
a wise thing to do.  Your PC contains very sensitive electronic
equipment which can easily be damaged by power surges that may
occur following lightning strikes during storms.

Being present near a storm can also be dangerous.

Remain close to storms at your own risk.

Use this program at your own risk.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.
