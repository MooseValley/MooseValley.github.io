Columns v1.1 (June 94) for DOS.            by Moose O'Malley

FREE Ware !

This Prototype version of Columns is FREE Ware, and you can
copy, distribute, and use it freely as long as this
message remains intact.

The program operates in character mode only.  i.e. it is not a graphical
program, so it will work on any monitor : CGA, EGA, VGA, etc, and 
will run on any PC (with an Intel CPU from 8088 to Pentium Pro), 
and with any amount of memory (it only needs a few dozen KB).

It runs on my 8086 640 KB CGA laptop, and it runs (at the same speed) 
on my Pentium 100 / 16 MB / SVGA.

It also runs under Windows 3.1, 95, NT, but as a DOS application.

This program was written in Turbo Pascal v3 / v5 (DOS).

I wrote this version of Columns in about 1 hour, as it
was based on my Tetris game.

The game is still very rough, and it could do with a 
great deal of polishing.

If you like this program, please EMail me and let me know.

It may encourage me to do a Windows version !!
