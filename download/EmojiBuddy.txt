Introduction :
--------------

Emoji Buddy is a simple little program that lets you
quickly and easily access some of my favourite Unicode
Emoji and other characters.

Click any button and the Unicode character is copied into
the Clipboard buffer on your Windows, Mac, Linux computer,
so you can paste it into Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, any
word processing document, presentation, spreadsheet, etc.

If you place the mouse pointer over any button, a tooltip
will display the a brief description of the Unicode character.
e.g. "Rolling on Floor Laughing".

If you want all of the Unicode characters, click the "All"
button and paste them wherever you need them.

No need to visit web sites, or load a word processing document
containing your favourite Emojis, just run my tiny Emoji Buddy
program and click a button and then paste the characters wherever
you need it.

I personally use Emoji Buddy several times a day on my machines.
Perhaps someone out there will also find it useful ?

This program will run on ANY operating system that is capable of
running the JVM, including desktops, laptops, and tablets running
Windows, Linux, Unix, etc, such as PCs, Macs, Raspberry PI, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company,
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.


Using this Program :
--------------------

Download and install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for
your machine / OS (if it is not already installed on your machine):

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Extract the contents of the EmojiBuddy.zip file you
downloaded from my web site to a folder on your machine.

And then, double click on:

	EmojiGUI.jar

icon / file to run the game in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Note: You can use Ctrl + Mouse Wheel to increase / decrease fonts,
just like you can with web pages in a web browser.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- More Emoji's / Unicode characters

- Add your own Emoji's

- Anything else ?

suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.
