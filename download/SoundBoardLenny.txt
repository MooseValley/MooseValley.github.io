Introduction :
--------------

SoundBoard Lenny runs under the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM).

SoundBoard Lenny is a collection of buttons that
play specific sounds, and buttons that play random sounds or
stop all sounds playing.  The sounds included are all FREE,
public domain sounds.

A Live Demo of the Sound Board Lenny is available on YouTube:
https://youtu.be/kUUNG4zAuRU

These sounds are perfect for tying up phone scammers to waste their
time and stop them from targetting others.  Help fight the good fight !
Simply put your phone next to your PC's speaker and press buttons to
let Lenny do the talking.

Use any of the pre-set buttons to respond to the phone scammer.

If you aren't sure how to reply, click the "Play 1 Random" sound button
and let random numbers select the sound for you.

If you are tired of stringing the phone scammers along, click the
"Play Many Random to play random sounds sequentially, one after the
other, until you click the "Stop Sounds" button.

Or if you really want to blow the phone scammers mind, click the
"Modern Life" button to play multiple sounds at once.

This software will run on ANY operating system that is capable of
running the JVM, including desktops, laptops, and tablets running
Windows, Linux, Unix, etc, such as PCs, Macs, Raspberry PI, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company,
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

sequentially, one after the other, until you click the
"Stop Sounds" button.

* Click the "Modern Life" button to keep playing multiple random
sounds at once, over the top of each other - it is hilarious,
and will blow phone scammers minds.

Enjoy ! :)


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- More sounds, themes, impersonations, etc.
  (I'd love to do my own Judge Judy sound board, or Arnie sound board,
   but these would cause legal problems).

- Want me to add any sounds ?  They must be free, public domain sounds.
  If so, let me know.  I don't want any copyright issues.

- Ummmm .... anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.
