ASCII Table v0.1 (Dec 1985) for DOS.            by Moose O'Malley

FREE Ware !

This is a very old program to write out an ASCII
table to a file - with the character, and the decimal,
binary, octal, and hexadecimal indexes.


It is FREE Ware, and you can copy, distribute, and 
use it freely as long as this message remains intact.

The program operates in character mode only.  i.e. it is not a graphical
program, so it will work on any monitor : CGA, EGA, VGA, etc, and 
will run on any PC (with an Intel CPU from 8088 to Pentium Pro), 
and with any amount of memory (it only needs a few dozen KB).

It runs on my 8086 640 KB CGA laptop, and it runs (at the same speed) 
on my Pentium 100 / 16 MB / SVGA.

It also runs under Windows 3.1, 95, NT, but as a DOS application.

This program was written in Turbo Pascal v3 / v5 (DOS).
