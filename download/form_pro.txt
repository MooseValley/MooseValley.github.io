Introduction :
--------------

WEB Form Formatter is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP
and similar.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

This program formats the results of a Emailed WEB Form.

For example, if a user fills out a WEB Page Form, such as a customer
survey, and then the completed form is Emailed to another user
(such as an administrator of the WEB Page), the WEB form data 
will arrive looking something like this :

	Your+Name+%3D+=Moose&Your+Email+Address+%3D+=moose%40maximum.net
	&Today%27s+Date+%3D+=11%2DNov%2D2002&Game+%3D+=Tutankham

i.e. the data is almost complete gibberish !

However, after Copying & Pasting this text into the WEB Form 
Formatter, and pressing the "Process Text" button, the data 
will look like this :

	Your Name = Moose
	Your Email Address = moose@maximum.net
	Today's Date = 11-Nov-2002
	Game = Tutankham

i.e. the data is now understandable and usable.

If the "Show Text after '=' only" checkbox is toggled,
then the WEB Form Formatter will format the data as follows :

	Moose
	moose@maximum.net
	11-Nov-2002
	Tutankham

which might be more useful for some people.

BTW, the above form data is the output of a Survey Form that 
used to be on my WEB Page to enable people to vote for 
their favourite Arcade Game.

You can open emails that contain emailed web form data, and 
select it all and paste it into WEB Form Formatter and process it.

Or, if you have used the "Create Shortcut on SendTo Menu" option 
under the file menu, then you can save the form data to file, and 
right mouse click on it and send it to Form_Pro directly.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

WEB Form Formatter is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP
and similar.  This program will **NOT** run under 
Windows 3.x (even with Win32 installed) !!


The Future :
------------

I don't know yet what features people will use / need.  

Later on, I may add other features, allow people to define 
columns that the ouput to conform to, etc.  But, I need people 
to tell me what they want.  So, please do.  ;)


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.1    13-Oct-1996  First Public Release.

1.2    01-Dec-1996  Add in "Format into columns" option to format
                    form text from my WEB Page (Arcade Game) Survey.
                    Save values of "Show text after '=' only" and 
                    "Format into columns" settings.

1.3    24-Jan-1997  Add in "Copy to Clipboard" and "Copy From Clipboard"
                    buttons, and a "Format all in 1 Line" option.

1.4    27-Jan-1997  Add in Registration functionality.

1.5    17-Jun-1997  Add in Menu items for viewing my Shareware Catalog, 
                    the Readme file, and the Registration Form.

1.6    11-Jan-1998  Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (2,846 lines of code / comments.)

1.7    29-Mar-2000  Fix bug with the handling of dozens of form fields which
                    contain long data.  (Thanks for reporting this Chris !).
                    Add in Form scaling when resized.
                    Fix NT Warning on Shutdown on some PCs.
                    Store the INI settings file in the program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    (5,323 lines of code / comments.)

2.0    26-Nov-2002  The default release for this program is now Windows 
                    95 / NT or later.
                    Remove the "Format into Columns" and "Format all in 1 Line"
                    options - nobody seemed to use them.
                    Completely rewrite the data processing engine, and run a large 
                    selection of simple and complex forms through the program to 
                    make sure everything is working.
                    The program will now accept forms up to 2 GB in size - should 
                    be more than big enough for everyone ... ;)
                    Add File Menu options to enable the user to create or delete 
                    shortcuts to this program on the Desktop, StartMenu, SendTo, etc
                    and you can do this *ANY* time - not just when the program is 
                    being installed.  (All Windows programs should provide this 
                    functionality).
                    You can now right-mouse click on a file and sent it to
                    WEB Form Formatter directly - provided there is a shortcut
                    to WEB Form Formatter in the SendTo menu.  (See above).
                    Add Restore Factory Defaults, Always on Top, and 
                    Auto-Run at Windows Startup options to the File menu.
                    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts".
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Brand New About Screen and associated functionality.
                    Add in support for the Maximise icon in the top right
                    corner of the program's main window.
                    This program is now for 32 bit Windows or later.  
                    e.g. Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, or later.
                    i.e. Windows 3.x is no longer supported.
                    Various interface enhancements - pictures on buttons, etc.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (46,290 lines of code / comments.)

2.1    21-Jul-2003  Various usability improvements.
                    Enable the user to drag and drop a file to process.
                    Enable the user to select a file to process.
                    Add in a "Load File" button so that the data from 
                    either of these sources can be loaded.
                    Add in a "Reset" button to reset all text areas.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (53,771 lines of code / comments.)

2.1f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.


If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is most likely an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my Home page and its mirrors.
