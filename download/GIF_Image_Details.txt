Introduction :
--------------

GIF Image Details is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, 
netbooks, etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which 
includes Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

GIF Image Details displays information about a GIF image, and allows you 
to step through each frame of animation and save each frame to separate 
bitmap (BMP) files or copy each frame and information about the GIF to 
Windows Clipboard.  You can also move or copy the GIF to a selected 
directory.  To get started, simply use the File -> Open GIF File menu 
option, or use "open file" button above the GIF image, or just the 
drag and drop a GIF image file onto the main window using Windows Explorer.

If you have a lot of GIF images that you want to examine / extract / 
review, sort out, then GIF Image Details will help you with this.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP
file to a directory - such as c:\GIF_Image_Details\ - and run
the executable file GIF_Image_Details.EXE.

Simply use the File -> Open GIF File menu option, or 
use "open file" button above the GIF image, or just the drag and drop 
a GIF image file onto the main window using Windows Explorer, 
and then use the radio buttons and buttons as follows:
* The little "open file" button above the GIF image display area allows 
  you to select a GIF file.
* Use the radio buttons to see a report for the GIF, manually step through 
  the GIF's animation frames, and or see all animation frames for the GIF.
* The little "copy" button (in the bottom right hand corner of the report) 
  copies the GIG summary report to window's clipboard.
* "Curr Frame" button: Save BMP of current frame to selected directory
* "All Frames" button: Save BMP of ALL frames (one BMP per frame) to selected directory
* "Move GIF" button:   Move GIF to selected directory
* "Copy GIF" button:   Copy GIF to selected directory
* "Clipboard" button:  Copy current frame to Windows Clipboard
* The little "open folder" button next to the selected directory edit box allows 
  you to select the directory where you want to save BMP files and/or move or copy 
  GIFs when you click the above buttons.  You can also drag and drop a folder 
  (directory) onto the program's window using Windows Explorer to set / change 
  the selected directory.

You can also right-mouse click on the program's window and access ALL of 
this functionality from a pop-up menu.

NOTE: 
* The frames of GIF images are usually compressed to reduce file size (and increase 
  display and download speed and reduce bandwidth when used on web pages).  
  That is, they contain just the pixels that have changed since the last frame, 
  with everything else empty / blank.  This means that if you save / copy selected 
  frame(s) of a GIF, then they may be incomplete and contain areas with no pixel 
  colours / information.  i.e. the may appear to have "holes" in them.
  This is *NOT* an error with my program - it is simply how GIF's work.


The report shows file name, file size, dimensions, etc for the GIF.  
Here's an example:

-------------------------------------------------------
anim_altered_beast_small.gif
File Size:       55.8 KB
Width:           178
Height:          159
Is Animated:     Yes
Frames:          7
Loop Iterations: 0
Animation Speed: 100
Transparent:     Yes
Opaque:          No
-------------------------------------------------------

See below for the definitions of each of these terms.


Definitions :
-------------

* File Size:
The size of the GIF file, in KB, MB, GB, etc (whatever is appropriate for the file).

* Width:
The width of the GIF image in pixels.

* Height:
The height of the GIF image in pixels.

* Is Animated:
Whether the GIF is an animated GIF (multiple frames) or a single frame GIF 
(a standard image).

* Frames:
The number of frames of animation in the GIF.

* Loop Iterations:
How many times the GIF will loop through all frames of animation.
0 = keep looping forever.

* Animation Speed:
The relative speed at which animations are played back.  The value is as a 
percentage of the GIF-specified speed and defaults to 100.  When you create 
the GIF (using GIF creation software), if you set the speed to 50 and then 
it will animate at half the speed compared to when the speed is 100.

* Transparent:
With GIFs you can have them set to transparent, but if you don't save them 
with the background colour set to the colour that makes them transparent, 
then they wont be transparent at all.
e.g. if I have a GIF with a red dragon on a white background, and I set 
it to transparent for the colour blue, then the GIF wont be transparent 
at all - it will be a red dragon on a white background.  But, if I set 
the transparent colour to white, then all you will see is a red dragon 
with no background.

* Opaque:
Whether the GIF is opaque or not.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Display other GIF details.
  Need anything ?  Email me and let me know.

- Support for other types of GIF file ?
  Are any needed ?  Email me and let me know.
  
- Ability to move back and forwards through all GIFs in a directory.
  Need this ?  Email me and let me know.

- Ability to process multiple GIF files at once and display their 
  specifications / details in a table.
  Need this ?  Email me and let me know.

- Anything else ?  Email me and let me know.  :)

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.


Special Thanks :
----------------

* Special thanks to Suzy Q for requesting this program.
She needed this program to sort out her GIF files.
Hopefully other people will find it useful.  :)

* Also, special thanks to Theodor Kleynhans of Sulako Developments 
(was at: http://www.sulako.com but web site seems to be gone now) 
for his excellent TGIFImage component for Delphi which sure helped me a 
lot and saved me a lot of work for this program.
I am still using v3.0 of Theodor's component which dates way back to 
Sep-1999, but it works perfectly and does all I need, so why change ?
If it ain't broke, why fix it ?


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------
