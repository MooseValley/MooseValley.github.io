Introduction :
--------------

Morse Code Explorer for Windows 3.1, 3.11, 95, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

This program enables you to explore the wonders of Morse Code.

With this program, you can :

- Decode a Morse Code string.
  Simply type in a series of DOTs (full stops) and DASHes (minus signs)
  and seperate each seperate morse code by a space, and the program
  will convert it to text for you.

- Encode text into Morse Code.
  Simply type in text and the program will convert it to Morse Code 
  for you.  All characters not included in Morse's Code are ignored.

- Display all Morse Code codes for each letter in the alphabet.
  i.e. a quick reference chart.


Morse Code : a little history
-----------------------------

When Samuel Morse decided to use an alphabetical system 
of signals for his newly invented telegraph, he consulted a 
Philadelphia newspaper's typecase.  Morse desired to assign the 
shorter dot-and-dash symbols used for telegraph transmission to 
the more commonly used letters of the alphabet, while some 
of the longer dot-and-dash symbols would be used for less 
frequently used characters.

In counting the type in each letter bin, he found 
12,000 e's, 9,000 t's, 8,000 each of a, o, m, i, and s, 
6,400 h's, and so on.  With few exceptions, Morse followed 
this list in developing his teletype code, assigning the 
shortest symbol, a dot, to the letter "e", the most 
common letter.  The symbol dash, was assigned to the 
letter t, the next most common symbol.

Modern International Morse Code only differs slightly from 
Morse's original Morse Code.

The duration of a dot equals one dot-unit, a dash equals three 
dot-units, the space between dots and dashes of a letter 
equals 1 dot-unit, and the space between letters equals 
three dot units.

The transmission of an English message consisting of 100 letters 
requires the transmission of approximately 940 dot-units.

If, instead of assigning symbols logically, they had been 
assigned at random, then the same 100 letter message would 
take 1160 dot-units - an increase of about 23%.

This encoding technique represents the earliest application of 
Statistical Compression for data transmission, and permits 
almost 25% more messages on a telegraph line during a peak 
period, than if dot-and-dash symbols were assigned at random.

Amazing hey !!

And, if it wasn't for Morse, we wouldn't have had all those excellent
Wild West movies where the telegraph operators are always held at gun
point and told to transmit wrong information to the sheriff in the next 
town.  (And who couldn't love these movies ???  ;)

The Future :
-------------

In the future, I might add a Tutorial / Quiz function
into the program, which would display random Morse Codes
and you would have to guess the character it represents.

Another good thing would be to play the DOTs and DASHes through 
your sound card so that it sounds similar to a real Telegraph.
** Done in v2.0f

I would also like to add functionality to read microphone input
and interpret this as DOTs and DASHes.

Or, this could be easily done with a mouse as well - tap the mouse 
botton for a DOT and hold it down a bit longer for a DASH - just 
like in a real Telegraph where Morse Code was pioneered.
** Done in v2.0f

It all depends on what feedback and support I get.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.0     07-Feb-97   First Public Release.
1.1     16-Jun-97   Save settings automatically on Windows 95 shutdown 
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Start Minimised if set in Shortcut / settings
                    (Registered Users only).  
                    Improve application startup - size and position 
                    form before user sees it.
                    Add in Menu items for viewing my Shareware Catalog, 
                    the Readme file, and the Registration Form.
1.2     11-Jan-98   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (3,224 lines of code.)
1.3     08-Nov-98   Add in support for the Norweigan characters
                    Æ (A combined with an E), Ø (O with an slash), 
                    and Å (A with a little circle over it).
                    Added specially for : Øivind Grønli Helgesen.
                    (3,700 lines of code.)

1.4   11-Jan-2001   Store the INI settings file in the program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    Fix an old bug in Borland Delphi / Windows NT
                    to fix NTDLL.DLL errors on closedown which occured 
                    on some Windows NT configurations.
                    Improve the detection method used for determining whether 
                    data copied from the clipboard is text or morse code.  
                    (If input data is made up of more than 99.5% dots, dashes, 
                    and spaces, then it is presumed to be More Code).
                    The Percentage of input data that is valid Morse Code
                    is now displayed next to the Input box / field.
                    (6,725 lines of code / comments.)

1.5  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (7,700 lines of code / comments.)

1.5b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (31,498 lines of code / comments.)

2.0f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.
                    Add in the ability to assign the DOT and DASH sounds and 
                    play any morse code back to the user.
                    Also, allow the user to left and right mpouse click in a 
                    specific area to play DOT and DASH sounds (respectively)  
                    while also entering DOTs and DASHes into the input box.
                    I had a lot more plans for this program, but alas a complete
                    lack of support, and a plethora of cracks and hacks for my 
                    software, have effectively scuppered these plans.


If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is possibly an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my WEB page - see below.
