Talking Clock Sounds		Copyright (C) Moose O'Malley, 
--------------------

The WAV files in this archive are for use with 
Registered versions of my Talking Clock program.

The WAV files require a password to be extracted from 
this ZIP archive.  Only Registered Users get this password.

The WAVs are recordings of John Carsey's brilliant 
and hillarious impersonations of Duke Nukem - a 
character in the great computer game Duke Nukem 3D
by 3D Realms.

John recorded his impersonations for the sole purpose
of being used with Talking Clock.  John's original 
WAVs were edited and optimised by me to produce the 
set in this archive.

The WAV set features multiple prefix and suffix sound
files - which are supported and played by the
Registered version of Talking Clock.

These sound files are Copyright (C) and cannot be 
edited or modified and no other use can be made of 
them without written prior permission from me.
