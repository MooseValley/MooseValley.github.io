Introduction :
--------------

File Usage Monitor for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

File Usage Monitor simply monitors and logs the usage of 
user-selected files.

In many service oriented companies - particularly in 
Legal Offices, Accountants, Graphic Designers, 
Computer Consultancies, etc - customers / clients are 
billed for each hour of work done on their behalf.

File Usage Monitor enables these companies to justify / support
work invoices sent to clients by logging the amount of
time spent working on computer files relating to each client.

Other uses include helping staff in companies fill in 
detailed time / task recording sheets which require you to
log what work you did during each hour of the day.

As far as I know, nothing like this application exists already,
and this application is completely unique.

I would especially like to thank my brother, Peter O'Malley,
for his original and brilliant idea for this program.
Peter has got a Registered Version of the program, it is
just a shame he uses a MAC not a PC !!  ;)

If a CPU lockout occurs or the PC hangs for a while, I have 
especially coded the program so that such lockouts are
ignored in the log.  i.e. time will not be added to the
logged usage for a file while the PC is hung.

You cannot also stop / pause logging if the mouse is inactive
for a number of seconds that you can specify on the Settings Screen.


How to use File Usage Monitor :
-------------------------------

File Usage Monitor's main screen consists of a row of buttons 
and a grid.  The grid consists of 3 columns which display 
displays the File Name(s), the current status of each file, 
and the logged usage time so far.

All buttons in this program have Tooltips, so just let the 
mouse pointer hover over the button and pretty soon, a 
Tool Tip help will appear to explain what the button does.

To Add files to the list to be monitored, click on the 
"Add File" button - the leftmost button.

To see the full name and full path for a file, click on 
the file's row in the grid and and the file's full name 
will appear the below the grid.

To remove a file from the list to be monitored, click on 
the row of the grid that the file is in, and then click 
the "Remove File" button - the 2nd button from the left.

To Reset the Logged Usage Time for a file, click on the 
row of the grid that the file is in, and then click the 
"Reset Logged Time" button - the 3rd button from the left.

To halt / stop the Logging of File Usage, simply click 
the "Stop / Halt all logging" on the far right of the 
main window.

To call up help, press the "Help" button, or select 
the "Help" menu and choose the "Help" option.

No other buttons work in this program - yet !!  


Limitations of File Usage Monitor :
----------------------------------

At the moment, this program can only log file usage if file 
locking occurs.  e.g.  When you edit a document in MS Word, 
Word "locks" the document to prevent other accesses until 
you finish editing and close the document.  Excel, Power 
Point, Lotus 1-2-3, Access, WordPerfect, Corel Draw, and 
most large commercial packages perform this locking.

Some programs, like Notepad, Word Pad, Paint Shop Pro, etc 
do NOT lock your files while they are being worked on.  As 
a result of this, File Usage Monitor cannot log any access 
to files within these programs - yet !

But, I am working on ways around this as we speak !!  
(See "The Future" below).

Many DOS programs lock files (such as WordPerfect for DOS, 
Lotus 1-2-3 for DOS, etc), and as long as these are run 
under Windows and other Windows applications are still 
multi-tasking, then File Usage Monitor will monitor file usage 
of files in these DOS programs as well !!

If you are not sure whether the application(s) you are using 
lock open files, select a file for that application in File 
Usage Monitor and see if the "File Status" changes while 
the file is being edited in the particular application.

Support for programs that do NOT lock files is being worked 
on as we speak !!


The Future :
-------------

This is an early release of the program, and many interesting 
things could be done in the future.

This program could well turn into a large and complex 
application, with the following sorts of features : 

- Add a Client column so that the hours spent working on 
  all files for a client can be easily seen.

- Add a Detailed Log File for each file being monitored so 
  that you can see the various start / stop dates / times 
  for when work was undertaken on each particular file.

- Add in a Client Report button which generates a report 
  containing : File name, logged work time (in Hours), 
  with a month by month breakdown and an overall total.

- Add in Sort functionality to sort on the various columns.

- Add in the ability to ignore file usage events of less 
  than 15 seconds (say).

- Add in extra file filters on the Select File dialog, such 
  as *.doc, *.xls, *.wk*, *.ppt, *.drw, etc.

- Help File - full blown, context sensitive help for the 
  application.

- Group Working functionality to generate reports for each 
  client even when many people are working on files relating 
  to the client.

- A Macintosh version of the program.

- Add in functionality to save the File Usage Log periodically 
  (say every 5 minutes), to minimise the impact of a total system 
  crash on the log.

- Add in a Setup screen to enable the user to customise the program.

- Work on getting File Usage Monitor to log file usage in 
  applications that do NOT lock files while they are being 
  worked on.  See "Limitations of File Usage Monitor" above.

- Anything else ?  Just Email me with suggestions / comments !!

The list is almost endless !!

What upgrades I do depends on what sort of response I get to 
this program, and what other suggestions I get.


Monitoring How Long Windows has been running :
----------------------------------------------

Need to keep track of how long you use Windows ?
Many people need to do this inorder to coordinate Backups
and other activities.  Well, File Usage Monitor can help !!

Many files that are opened (with write locks) when Windows starts
and are closed down when Windows exits.  These files are perfect
for monitoring how long Windows has been running.

For example, in Windows 95, these files can be used :

	c:\Win386.swp
	c:\windows\system\Mapisp32.exe
	c:\windows\system\winspool.drv
	c:\windows\system\systray.exe
	c:\windows\Win386.swp  (Windows Swap File)

Suitable files are not hard to find - press Ctrl-Alt-Del when 
Windows 95 starts up and look at the list of system files.  
There are other utilities where you can see loads of other 
drivers that are loaded as well if you want to use others.

Or you can hook into files belonging to other Windows applications - 
such as McAfee's virus scan that loads when Windows starts :

	c:\Program Files\McAfee\Vshwin32.exe


Special Thanks to :
-------------------

I would especially like to thank the following people :

- My brother, Peter O'Malley, for his original and brilliant 
  idea for this program.  Peter has got a Registered Version of 
  the program for coming up with the idea, but it is just a 
  shame he uses a MAC not a PC !!  ;)
  (If Delphi is ever released on the MAC, I will do a MAC 
  version specially for you Peter !).

- Markus Oberhumer & Laszlo Molnar who have developed
  "The Ultimate Packer for eXecutables" (aka UPX), which 
  is used to compress the 32 bit EXE to less than 40%
  of it's original size.  Check out :
   * http://cdata.tvnet.hu/~ml/upx.html
   * http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html

  Sadly, this utility doesn't support Windows 16 bit executables, 
  so I am still searching for a good cheap / free Windows 
  16 bit EXE Packer.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.0   18-Apr-1997   First Public Release.
                    Thank to my brother, Peter O'Malley, for his 
                    original and brilliant idea for this program.
1.1   24-May-1997   Save settings automatically on Windows shutdown 
                    (Registered Users only).
                    Start Minimised if set in Shortcut / settings
                    (Registered Users only).  
                    Improve application startup - size and position 
                    form before user sees it.
                    Put a Status Bar at the bottom of the Main 
                    Window to hold Icon & object tool tips.
                    Add in Menu items for viewing my Shareware 
                    Catalog, Readme file, and Registration Form.
1.2   13-Jun-1997   Save Window Height and Width on exit, and 
                    enable Main Window to be resized.
                    Build a 32 bit version for Windows 95 / NT
                    which enables Long File Names to be used, and
                    also enables File Usage Monitor to be placed
                    on the Icon Tray.
                    Make the "Add Files to be Monitored" button
                    multi-select, so you can add many files at once.
                    Add in a "Reset Usage" for all files button.
1.3   11-Jan-1998   Fix a long standing but very elusive problem
                    to do with "DateEncode" errors which occured
                    on some machines under some conditions.
                    Once I could replicate the error, it was
                    reasonably straight forward to get a workaround
                    for what was another bug in Delphi.
                    (3,216 lines of code / comments.)

1.4   18-Jul-2000   Add in the ability to Pause logging if a certain
                    period of mouse inactivity is encountered.
                    (Added in specially for Mark Radford).
                    (6,691 lines of code / comments.)

1.5  17-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (8,381 lines of code / comments.)

1.5b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (28,694 lines of code / comments.)
