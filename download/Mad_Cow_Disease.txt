Introduction :
--------------

Mad Cow Disease Diagnosis is a "for fun" program for Windows 
95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Simply click on the images displayed to hear sounds of normal 
and mad cows.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
--------------------------

I wrote this program because I have a personal "interest" 
in Mad Cow Disease.

From 1990 to 1996, I lived in the United Kingdom, and
I believed the lies of UK politicians who loudly and 
very publicly declared that British beef was 100% safe
and that there was absolutely no danger in eating it.
The politicians even wheeled their children out in front 
of TV cameras to eat hamburgers to convince the nation 
to eat beef.

So, I thought it was safe, and I ate lots of beef 
(steak, hamburgers, beef curry, chille con carne, 
roast beef, etc) during my stay in the UK.

However, when I returned to Australia in 1996, I 
discovered - much to my horror - that I was no longer 
able to donate blood because there is a real risk that I
am a carrier for Mad Cow Disease and that I might one-day 
develop the disease - all thanks to living in the UK and 
eating beef whilst there.

I thought the Australia Red Cross were joking when they 
rejected me as a blood donour in late 1996 - but they were 
deadly serious.

(Prior to this, I had been a regular blood donor).

So, now I am simply playing a waiting game - either I 
will contract the disease or I wont.

There is no cure.

My last and only defence is to laugh at the disease.

And to help this along, I have developed this program.


Credits / Thanks :
------------------

I obtained the sound files and pictures / animations
of the cows from various sites on the internet.
(They are available at many 1,000's of web pages).

However, I have no idea who originally prepared these,
and I would hazard a guess that most if not all of these
web site maintainers are similarly "in the dark" about this.  

(Whoever recorded the sound effects is either in serious
need of medication, or they already have contracted the 
disease ... ;))

So, if you know who is responsible, send me an email, 
and I will give them full credit here.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\mad_cow\ - and run the executable 
file : Mad_Cow_Disease.EXE.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up (but you would have to be "mad" to want this), 
then select this option under the "File" menu in the program.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete Mad Cow Disease 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

No plans at this stage - what more is there to do ??


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.


Freeware Information :
-----------------------

This is free software.  

Anyone - any person, any company, or any business - can 
use this program for free.  No fees or payment is required.
