Introduction :
--------------

N.B. This program is for use with versions of MAME 32 prior 
     to v0.63. If you are using MAME v0.63 or later, then 
     please use MAME 32 INI Tools.

MAME32 Tools for Windows 95 / 98 / NT / 2000 / ME / etc.

MAME32 Tools is a companion utility / tool for the 
MAME 32 Arcade Machine Emulator :

	http://www.mame.net

MAME32 Tools is also compatible with the various "unofficial" MAME 32 
emulators out there, such as MAME Screen Saver, Stretch MAME,
Advanced MAME, etc.

MAME32 INI Tools is a companion utility to MAME 32 - that means 
that it is designed to be used in conjunction with MAME 32.  
i.e. used in conjunction with the Windows GUI version of MAME.

Indeed, for MAME32 Tools to be fully functional, you need to have 
DOS MAME and MAME 32 (or StretchMAME, Advance MAME, etc) installed 
on your PC as well, and ideally, you should have run MAME 32 and 
used it to audit all ROMs before MAME32 Tools is used.

When you have done this, MAME32 Tools can provide some useful and 
powerful functionality.

This program does not have *ANY* in-built ROM auditing capabilities, 
as I could see absolutely no point in duplicating this functionality 
that is already provided by MAME 32.  To do so would have been a 
complete waste of time.  So, this program needs MAME 32 to tell it
which ROMs are correct, etc.

MAME32 Tools currently allows you to do a whole bunch of things,
and, listed by category, these are :



*********************************************
***   P L A Y E D   C O U N T S   tab    ****
*********************************************
- List All games supported by MAME32.
- List All MAME32 games that you have NEVER played.
- List All MAME32 games that you have played at least once.
- List All games where either the original or its clones have been played.
- List All games where neither the original nor its clones have NOT been played.
- Change the "Played Count" to ZERO for ALL MAME32 games.
- Change the "Played Count" to ONE for ALL MAME32 games.
- Change the "Played Count" to ONE for ALL MAME32 games that 
  you have NEVER played.
- Change the "Played Count" to ONE for ALL games where either the original 
  or its clones have been played.

*********************************************

*********************************************
- List All games which have matching ROM ZIP files.
- List All games which do NOT have matching ROM ZIP files.
  (These games could already be extracted to their own directory,
   or they could be inside another zip file.  i.e. one that doesn't
   have their name).
- List ROM ZIP files that are not associated with any game 
  currently supported by MAME 32.
- Move these Unused ROM ZIPs to another directory.
- Move all Clone ZIP files to another directory.

*********************************************
***   A U D I T  R E S U L T S   tab     ****
*********************************************
- List All games which were successfully audited by MAME 32.

- List all games that were successfully audited but have 
  never been played.

*********************************************
***   F A V O U R I T E S   tab          ****
*********************************************
- List games marked as Favourites in MAME 32.
- List games marked which are NOT Favourites in MAME 32.

*********************************************
***   S C R E E N  S H O T S   tab       ****
*********************************************
- List games that have screenshots in the screen shot directory and/or
  in SNAP.ZIP.
- List games which do NOT have any screenshots.
- List screenshots that are not directly associated with any game.
- List All games where either the original or its clones have a Screenshot(s).
- List All games where neither the original nor its clones have a Screenshot(s).
- Change the played count to ZERO for all games without screen shots.
  (This then enables you to sort games by played count in MAME 32, and play 
  the games that are missing screenshots so you can then pess F12 and 
  get the missing screenshots).
- Change the played count to One for all games which have screen shots
  but currently have a played count of zero.
  (This then enables you to sort games by played count in MAME 32, and play 
  the just those games that do not already have screenshots).
- Change the "Played Count" to ZERO for ALL MAME32 games where either the 
  original or its clones do NOT have any screenshot.
- Change the "Played Count" to ONE for ALL MAME32 games where either the 
  original or its clones have a screenshot.

*********************************************
***   S E T T I N G S   tab              ****
*********************************************
- Save / Load Settings : Column Order, Column Shown, Column Widths, List 
  Font, etc so when you install a new MAME, you can easily and quickly 
  get the column / order / size back to what you had previously.
- Select MAME version - based on where the Registry settings are stored.
  Currently, all known vcersions of MAME use either MAME32's Registry area
  or StretchMAME32's Registry area.
- "When a Game is Played, Update its Played Count" option.
- "Refresh Screen Shots After Each Game is Played" option.

*********************************************
***   U N U S E D  G A M E S   tab       ****

*********************************************
- MAME Tools can act as a front end to DOS MAME - which can be very handy,
  especially for later games which benefit from DOS MAME's extra speed.
  On this tab, you can setup your path and command line for DOS MAME.
  As soon as you do this, you can double click on a game in any list,
  and MAME Tools will load the game into DOS MAME.
  (See the DOS MAME tab in the program and the "DOS MAME Front End" below).

*********************************************
***   O R I G I N A L S  C L O N E S tab ****
*********************************************
- Press the "Refresh Originals / Clones" button to refresh this list.
  N.B.  You must have DOS MAME setup above to be able to do this,
  as the list of originals / clones is generated from DOS MAME
  -listclones output.
  The list of originals / clones is used in many places in 
  building lists for the above tabs.

*********************************************
***   R O M  T O O L S   tab             ****
*********************************************
- Checksum ROMs.
- Chop ROMs in half to fix incorrect size errors.

Clipboard button :
- Copy any of these lists of items to the Window's Clipboard.

Refresh button :
- Refresh all of the above lists.

Exit button :
- Exit the program and save current lists, so that they cna be reused
  next time the program is run.


Most of the above features are not supported by any other utility or
Front End.

Some people may find the above functionality useful to help them manage 
their MAME 32 installations to help them get even more enjoyment out of 
MAME.

MAME Tools also supports multiple ROM directories - see "Multiple ROM 
Directories" below.

If you do use this program, please send me an email and let me know.
If you like, I will also email you when new versions of MAME32 Tools
are released.  If people use the program, then I am more likely to 
enhance it further in the future.

This program is FREE - if you payed money for this program, then
you were ripped off and you should complain to the person who 
sold it to you.  (Don't complain to me, it's nothing to do with me).

This program is free for any company, business, individual, or anyone
else to use.

If you find this program useful, then please give something back by 
helping the arcade emulation community in some way.

MAME32 Tools is NOT an official part of the MAME project.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.


Why I wrote this Program / Why use this Program :
-------------------------------------------------

I wrote this program primarily because there were things I wished
MAME 32 could do.  Some of these things (like listing missing ROMs)
I could not add into MAME because they contravened the MAME 
license agreement.  I also didn't want to get into having to recompile
my own MAME every time a new version was released to add in support
for my additional functionality.  I also prefer programming in Delphi,
and MAME is primarily written in C++.

So, I wrote this program to do what I needed to do, and it has grown
into a very large and even more useful program since then.

Maybe, some other people out there will also find this program useful.

One question I have been asked a few times is : Why would anyone want 
to mess around with Played Counts ???

Well, I like playing all newly supported games when a new version
of MAME 32 is released.  (So many I have never seen, so it is just so 
much fun to experience them).  MAME 32 is sometimes prone to crashing
and played counts for all of the games you have played this session
are lost when a crash occurs.  By using MAME Tools to set the Played Counts 
of all games supported by the old version of MAME to 1 (or more), 
I can then install the new version of MAME 32 and sort the games 
by Played Count (within the emulator) and in that way just play 
the newly supported games.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply unzip it to a directory (using 
PKUNIP, WinZIP, or similar), run it, and click on the buttons to
view / perform the activities you require.

Tool tips (hints) are provided with all buttons.

Everything is clearly labelled and the program should be 
fairly straight forward to use.

When you run the program, everything is grayed out until
all of the various lists of things are refreshed.  This refresh
originally took less than 5 seconds on my Pentium III 667 PC,
but now that MAME supports over 3,100 games and I have added in loads of
extra lists, a full refresh of everything takes about 80 seconds.
(I'll improve this in the future - see "The Future" below).

When the Refresh is done, you can change tabs and click on buttons
to see the various lists and do the required processing.

The program started off pretty simple, but people have emailed
me and asked me to add in all sorts of other functionality
and lists, so it has sort of become quite big and complex 
now - far more complex that I ever really wanted.


MAME 32 and MAME Tools :
------------------------

When you run MAME 32, it reads settings (game lists, played 
counts, etc) from the registry.  Then when you close MAME 32, it 
writes all of its settings back to the registry.

If you run MAME Tools while MAME 32 is running, then any 
changes to played counts, etc you make with MAME Tools will be 
overwritten when you exit MAME 32.

In addition, MAME 32 will not pickup any changes that MAME 
Tools makes to played counts, etc unless you Refresh (F5) in 
MAME 32.

The best way to ensure that MAME 32 is not overwriting changes 
made by MAME Tools, is to exit MAME 32 *before* making any 
changes to played counts, etc with MAME Tools.

Another way is to Refresh MAME 32 (press F5) to get it to read back
in the lastest values / settings, which MAME Tools may have changed.


DOS MAME Front End :
--------------------

You can Double Click on a game in any of the lists and MAME Tools 
will load the game into DOS MAME.  (First you must setup 
your MAME command line and options under the "DOS MAME" tab).

After you have played a game, MAME Tools can automatically 
update the played count for the game.  (Select the checkboxes
on the "DOS MAME" tab).

This is useful since MAME 32 can be a bit unstable on some
games, and DOS MAME is more stable, and that is why I added 
this functionality into MAME tools.

To setup the DOS MAME functionality, you need to enter the DOS MAME 
command line required to run DOS MAME.  e.g.  c:\mame\mame.exe.
If required, you can also setup the parameters for MAME, such 
as video settings, sound card settings, etc.  e.g. -soundcard 1
See the readme.txt file that accompanies DOS MAME for further 
information about these.

See also "Multiple ROM Directories" below.


Multiple ROM Directories :
--------------------------

MAME Tools supports multiple ROM directories, so you can now keep
your ROMs split up in whatever seperate directories you like.

You need to tell MAME Tools which is the main ROM directory
(if this is "roms" below where MAME is installed), and MAME 
Tools reads what the other ROM directories are from what you have
setup in MAME 32.

In MAME 32, you can use the "Directories" optin under the "Options" 
menu to tell MAME 32 which directories contain ROM files.

Once you have done this (and exited MAME 32 to save the settings 
to the Registry), MAME Tools can read this directory list and
use these to find all of the ROM files.


Filtering Out No Longer Support Games :
----------------------------------------

MAME Tools filters out games that are no longer supported by MAME,
under the "Unused Games" tab.  The problem is that MAME 32
does not cleanup after itself and remove no-longer supported
games from the Registry.  

So, to get around this, there were 3 main choices : 

1) Delete all MAME registry keys before runing a new version 
   of MAME.  (This means you would loose your played counts
   an favourites settings for each game).

2) Download a new version of MAME Tools each time a new 
   version of MAME is released.  A lot of work all around !

3) Enable the user to type in the 3 or 4 games (to MAME Tools) 
   that are no longer supported for each MAME release.

Option 3 seemed the best all around, we are only talking about 
3 or 4 games anyway for each new MAME release.

Option 3 also meant that I don't need to create a new version of 
MAME Tools each time a new MAME is released (something I have
tried to avoid all along), and this means that users don't have 
to download new versions of MAME Tools all the time.

So users can now enter the 3 or 4 "no longer supported games" on 
the "Unused Games" tab each time a new MAME is released.


Limitations / Restrictions of the program :
-------------------------------------------

None.  There is no trial period and there is no "cutdown"
or "restricted" functionality that requires users to register.

This program is FREE software - any person and any company is
welcome to copy it, use it, and distribute it as they see fit,
as long as the EXEcutable and this text file remain intact.

If you paid money for this program, then you were ripped off,
and you should complain to the person who sold it to you !!
(Don't complain to me, it's nothing to do with me !!).


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Add support for UOMAME.  This program does something strange in 
  the registry with it's settings, etc, and I am just waiting for the
  author to reply to an email I have sent him asking a few questions.

- Sound Sample checking for each game.

- Marquee, Flyer, Cabinet checking for each game.

- Changing played counts to something other that 0 or 1.  (Why ?)

- Ability to Save Lists directly to disk.

- Ability to save and load played counts to disk so that when you 
  move to a new machine, your played counts can be taken with you !

- Who knows, maybe even a Linux version (when I can get Delphi for Linux).

- Speed up the time it takes to do a full refresh, or else allow
  the user to choose what they want to refresh.

- Ability to erase all Mame 32 or Stretch MAME 32 Registry settings.
  This can be useful when you install a new version of MAME - and you
  don't want no-longer supported games, etc hanging around and being
  listed.

- Speed up the processing done when the "Refresh Screen Shots After 
  Each Game is Played" option is checked.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, or would like to give me some feedback on the program,
please email me and let me know.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description
1.0   06-Nov-2000   First Public Release.

2.0   23-Jan-2001   Big changes for this new version !!
                    Roms directory entry box is now READ Only.
                    Remove the chance of divide by zero errors on the Progress Guage.
                    Add in a "Move Unused ROM ZIPs" button to enable you to move these 
                    unused ROM ZIPs to another directory.
                    Add in confirmation promts before changing the played counts.
                    Add in "View Favourites" and "View Non-Favourites"
                    Add in the ability to Save / Load Column Settings :
                    Column Order, Column Shown, Column Widths, List Font
                    (So when you install a new MAME, you can easily and quickly get 
                    the column / order / size back to what you had previously).
                    Add in Debugging and Verification functionality / report,
                    to help me sort out problems on a Windows 2000 user's PC.
                    Change the Icon to an icon based on MAME 32's icon.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    Add in Screen Shot auditing, so you can see which games
                    have screenshots, which games don't, and list any
                    screenshots that are not associated with any game.
                    Also, add in functionality to enable a user to
                    set the played count to ZERO for all games without screen shots.
                    (This then enables you to sort games by played count in MAME 32,
                    and play the games that are missing screenshots so you can then
                    press F12 and get the missing screenshots).  This functionality 
                    does NOT (yet) support screenshots inside the SNAP.ZIP file.
                    (Maybe in the future I'll add this ZIP support into the program).
                    Add in "Always On Top" menu option / functionality.
                    Use a different Registry key.  I have scanned the MAME 32 source code
                    and it appears that I wasn't using the latest / recommended Windows
                    registry key.  Even so, the program worked fine for me under Windows
                    98 and Windows NT.  But recently, a Windows 2000 user reported a problem
                    where the program just sat there with all buttons grayed out and nothing 
                    much happening.  This new registry key fixes that problem.  
                    (Hope you like it, Karlo !)
                    Finally, optimise the Refreshing.  From now on when you change something
                    (like Played Counts) then only items related to this are refreshed.
                    (8,496 lines of code / comments.)

2.1   20-Feb-2001   Add in "Degugging Messages On (During Refresh)", 
                    "Button Greying On (During Refresh)", and
                    "Show Progress Bars (During Refresh)" menu options.
                    Also, show Progress Bars for each item, during a Refresh.
                    Add in ZIP support for screenshots, which will now be 
                    searched for in the snapshot directory and in SNAP.ZIP. 
                    Fix problems encountered on a Windows 98 SE PC.  This involved 
                    adding in extra validation and verification of registry 
                    data.  (If you have ever run an old version of MAME 32 
                    then invalid data / keys can still be in the registry).
                    (Thanks Andy M. for your help / patience !)

                    (14,469 lines of code / comments.)

2.2  26-Feb-2001    DOS MAME Front End, Unsupported Games, Multi ROM Dirs.
                    See "DOS MAME Front End", "Multiple ROM Directories", and
                    "Filtering Out No Longer Support Games" above for further 
                    information on these changes / topics.
                    (16,214 lines of code / comments.)

2.3  01-Mar-2001    Big changes for this new version !!
                    Use "CreateProcess" instead of "ShellExecute" or the old 
                    fashioned "WinExec" to execute DOS MAME - this means that 
                    F12 now takes screenshots correctly.  (For some reason that 
                    probably only Microsoft would know, F12 did not work with 
                    WinEXEC, but all the other function keys did).
                    Improve the running of DOS MAME - the DOS Box window now 
                    closes automaticaly when MAME Exits.
                    Improve MAME Tools startup - all lists are now saved on 
                    exit, and re-loaded when you run the program again.  This 
                    means that a Refresh is not done automatically when you
                    start up MAME Tools - only when you press the "Refresh" button.
                    The enter / return key now runs the currently selected game.
                    i.e. it works like a double-click.
                    Add in support for Clones and Originals.  (A DOS MAME command 
                    needs to be run to get this information, so DOS MAME needs 
                    to be setup under the DOS MAME tab.
                    Add in lists for :
                    - List All games where either the original or its clones 
                      have been played.
                    - List All games where either the original or its clones 
                      have NOT been played.
                    - List All games where either the original or its clones 
                      have a Screenshot(s).
                    - List All games where neither the original nor its clones 
                      have a Screenshot(s).
                    Add in the following play count changing functionality :
                    - Change the "Played Count" to ONE for ALL games where 
                      either the original or its clones have been played.
                    - Change the "Played Count" to ZERO for ALL MAME32 games 
                      where either the original or its clones do NOT have any 
                      screenshot.
                    - Change the "Played Count" to ONE for ALL MAME32 games 
                      where either the original or its clones have a screenshot.

2.4  11-Apr-2001    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.

                    Save the MAME version on exit, and re-load this next 
                    time Mame Tools is re-run, so that this is available even 
                    when the user does not Refresh after startup.
                    Add in support for StretchMAME32 - which stores its settings 
                    data in different Windows Registry area to MAME 32.
                    (17,660 lines of code / comments.)

2.5  11-Apr-2001    Add in support for StretchMAME 32, which saves its settings
                    in a different Registry area to other MAME 32 variants.
                    (See the "Settings" tab).
                    Add in a new "ROM Tools" tab, with buttons to checksum or 
                    chop in half any ROMs that you drag and drop onto the form.
                    Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically -

2.6  15-June-2001   Change to a Win 32 PageControl instead of a Windows 3.1 
                    Tabbed Notebook.  (These are much more flexible and easy 
                    to handle).  Fix a bug with a hardcoded file parameter in 
                    the refreshing of Originals and Clones.
                    Display all numbers and counts with a thousands "," seperator.
                    Work around a bug in Delphi / Windows where sorted listboxes
                    were not sorted according to the rules of any text string
                    comparison function built into Delphi.
                    (14,139 lines of code / comments.)
                    
2.7   22-Oct-2001   Add in extra progress bars for use during the refresh.
                    Make "When a Game is Played, Update its Played Count"
                    checked (true) by default.
                    Add in a "List all games that were successfully audited 
                    but have never been played" button / functionality.
                    Display MAME version and number of games supported in 
                    the title bar.
                    Add in an option to "Refresh Screen Shots After Each Game 
                    is Played" under the Settings Tab.
                    Add in the ability to move Clone ZIP files to another directory.
                    Add in a rough timer (it updates when it can - not every second),
                    and I have been using this to help to optimise my code.
                    Optimise the Refresh Time - by using my own hand built code 
                    instead of calling Windows' functions, I reduced the refresh 
                    time from 88 seconds to less than 18 seconds on my Pentium III 
                    667 MHz for MAME v0.54 (with 3,113 games).  This proves again that 
                    there is no substitute for experience, and I'll put my 20+ years 
                    of computer programming experience up against Microsoft's best 
                    programmers any day of the week.  So, how about it boys ??  ;)
                    Massively speed up closing / exiting the program by
                    only saving those lists of items that have changed during the
                    current run of the program.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Brand New About Screen and associated functionality.
                    Add in support for the Maximise icon in the top right 
                    corner of the program's main window.
                    (20,521 lines of code / comments.)

3.0  01-June-2002   Add in "Use the Above Defaults" button on the DOS MAME tab.
                    (This saves typing in the suggested options, if these
                    are useful / applicable to you or useful as a starting point
                    for whatever your command line is for DOS MAME).
                    Pressing the Ctrl key on a game in a list now runs the game
                    in DOS MAME.  (Superb for using this program as a MAME front end
                    in my MAME arcade cabinet !!).  So, you can now double click on
                    a game, press ENTER or press Ctrl to run the selected
                    (i.e. highlighted) game.
                    Remember the last used Tab next time the program is run.
                    Remember the last clicked List Button next time the program is run.
                    When refreshing just the Played Counts, position all of the relevant
                    progress bars to 100% to better show progress for the refreshing.
                    If the user drags and drops any files (e.g. ROMs) onto MAME Tools,
                    then ensure that the "ROM Tools" tab is the active page.
                    Add in better reporting when a game's you want to run cannot be found.  
                    Change over to using MAME 32's new RomPath registry key instead of 
                    the no-longer used RomDirs registry key.
                    Fix game count in Windows Title area - it was 2 too many. (. and ..).
                    Fix count displayed when you press the button for changing the "Played 
                    Count" to ZERO for ALL MAME32 games where either the original or its 
                    clones do NOT have any screenshot.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.

3.1   20-Nov-2002   Fix the moving of Unused ROM ZIPs and Clone ROM ZIPs - there
                    was a bug with the directory processing if multiple ROM directories
                    are used.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
