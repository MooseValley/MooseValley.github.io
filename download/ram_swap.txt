Introduction :
--------------

RAM / SWAP Monitor is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, netbooks, 
etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which includes 
Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

RAM / SWAP Monitor displays:
- the CPU usage and the Average CPU usage (since RAM / Swap 
  Monitor has been running).  If your PC has multiple CPUs / cores, 
  then the CPU Usage is the average across all CPUs.
- graphs and numerical values for the Physical RAM and 
  SWAPfile (Page file) usage in your PC,
- the free space and total capacity of any single drive 
  selected by the user, and you can view a report for the selected drive 
  by clicking the little button next to the drive selection drop down box.
- and, if the "Show Mouse Odometer" option is "checked" in the 
  "Mouse Odometer" menu, the number of left / right mouse botton 
  clicks and the distance the mouse pointer has travelled in Km or Miles.

RAM / SWAP Monitor also contains "CPU Usage Drop alarm" 
functionality which plays a sound over and over again until 
the user clicks the OK button when the CPU usage drops below 
a user specified level for a user specified number of seconds.  
This is very useful for telling you when a big job has ended, 
such as a Virus Scan, Disk Scan, Disk Defragment, CD/DVD Burning, 
video processing and conversions, etc.  This functionality is available 
under the "CPU Usage Drop Alarm" menu option in the "File" menu.
(I use this all the time, so I can watch TV or do something else, 
and my PC will make a sound and tell me when it has finised its work !!).

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply run it and observe the RAM usage
and SWAP file usage details change as you run it.

If you do not want to see the textual Free KB / Total KB 
details for RAM and SWAP, then simply re-size the window to
hide these details.

The Spinning Line (between the RAM and Swap labels) spins
everytime the RAM / Swapfile usage details are updated.
i.e. it confirms that the program is still operating -
even when the graphs are stable.

RAM / SWAP Monitor for Windows 95 / 98 / NT only.
This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x 
(even with Win32 installed) !!

If you want this program to be "Always On Top" 
of other Windows, then select the "Always On Top"
menu option under the "File" menu.


Why is this useful ?  /  Why do this ?
--------------------------------------

When RAM utilisation is high, then non-essential
chunks of code and data are automatically written 
(by Windows) to a special file known as a Swapfile 
or Page file, where they can be loaded again
(if and when needed) much faster than if the individual
chunks of code and data were searched for and loaded
again from their respective source files.

When RAM and/or Swap file utilisation is high, 
system performance can suffer dramatically.
When this happens, it is be best to buy more 
RAM and/or allocate more swap file space.

Also, if you find your temporary swap file is always 
dramatically changing in size / usage, then it may 
be best to allocate a permanent large swap file.
(This avoids lots of disk usage / disk thrashing 
caused when the temporary swapfile is resized).

If your permanent Swapfile is too small for your needs,
then non-essential chunks of code / data are thrown
away completely instead of written to the swapfile,
and will mean that they will have to be searched for 
and loaded again from their respective source files.
This is much slower than re-loading them from the 
Swapfile.

If your permenent Swapfile is far larger than you need,
then you can shrink it down and recover the disk space
for other needs.

RAM / SWAP Monitor can help you monitor your PC's
RAM / Swapfile usage, so that upgrade / system
tuning decisions can then be made.

Basically, all this means that you will be better
able to monitor what is happening in your PC and
tune it accordingly.

You may be surprised to see just how much RAM / Swap
Windows 95 / 98 / NT uses up just in loading itself.

N.B. To alter Swapfile size and temporary / permanent 
     settings, go to the Control Pannel, double click
     on the System icon.  
     In Windows 95 / 98, choose the "Performance" tab, 
     and then select the "Virtual Memory" button,
     you can now alter all Swapfile settings.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :
- Display average RAM and SWAP usage.
- Store these average RAM and SWAP usage details for
  use next time the program is run.
- Display the number of Threads (windows processes) currently
  running.
- Display % of free system resources.  Actually, this is already displayed - 
  when Windows reports the % of Free system resources, this is the percentage 
  of Free RAM.
- Add in other graph types - like speedometer, bar, etc.
- Display whether the Swapfile is dymanic or fixed size / static.
- Possibly enable the navigation directly to Windows Virtual 
  Memory (Swapfile) settings directly from this program - 
  instead of having to manually go via Control Pannel.
- Possibly do a 16-bit version of the program that will run
  under Windows 3.x.  (Anybody still using Windows 3.x ???  ;)
- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :

                    greater than 2 GB in size.
                    Put comma seperator in the 1,000's
                    in RAM and Swap File usage numbers.
                    Work around another bug in Borland Delphi 
                    to fix NTDLL.DLL errors on closedown which 
                    occured on some Windows NT configurations.
                    (3,314 lines of code / comments.)

                    in Windows NT.
                    Enhance "About ..." window with buttons to
                    copy my email and WEB page address to the
                    Window's clipboard, so user can simply
                    paste them into WEB Browser or Email program.
                    (3,887 lines of code / comments.)

2.3   25-Aug-1999   Work around another bug in Borland Delphi so 
                    Ram Swap can correctly handle 30 GB and far 
                    larger drives.  (Fix required due to errors
                    in Borland's suggested fix FAQ2552D on 
                    their WEB site).
                    (3,831 lines of code / comments.)

2.5   18-Apr-2000   Fix error reported when drive is not ready.
                    e.g. Floppy or CD removed removed from drive
                    being monitored.
                    Add in Form and Component Scaling when the program's 
                    main window is resized - really Cool !!
                    Add in "Always On Top" functionality - available 
                    from the "File" menu.  (Added especially for 
                    my good friend Patrick Cullinan !)
                    (6,001 lines of code / comments.)

3.0   18-Jan-2001   Add in functionality to make the PC's Speaker Beep 
                    or make some sound whenever the CPU usage drops below 
                    a user specified level for a user specified number of 
                    seconds.  This could come in handy for telling you when 
                    a big job has ended, such as a Virus Scan, Disk Scan, 
                    Disk Defragment, CD Burning, etc.
                    This functionality is available under the 
                    "CPU Usage Drop Alarm" menu option, under the "File" menu.
                    (I use this new option all the time, so I can watch TV 
                    or do something else, and my PC will beep and tell me 
                    when it has finised the job !!).
                    (7,343 lines of code / comments.)

                    ****     Advanced Notification    ****
                    N.B. As soon as I get the CPU Usage fixed under Windows NT, 
                         this program is going up to $10 (from $5), so if you 
                         are thinking of buying it, maybe you should buy it  
                         NOW at the cheaper price !!

4.0   22-Jan-2001   This is a Massive Update !!!!
                    Many dozens of hours of work went into this release !!
                    Fix CPU Usage under Windows NT - finally.  Whoo Hoo !! Yee Haa !!!
                    (This took one HELL of a lot of work, code, and trial-and-error !!!
                    The code required to get CPU usage under Win NT is an absolute 
                    nightmare - some of the most convoluted and hideous code and
                    Win API's I have *ever* had to deal with.  Rotten Microsoft !!)
                    Also, if your PC has multiple CPUs, then the CPU Usage 
                    reported by RAM / Swap Monitor is the average across all CPUs.
                    (Maybe in the future when multi-CPU PCs become a bit more common, 
                    I'll add in a graph for each CPU.  If you want this, let me know !)
                    As advised, the price of this program is $10 from now on.
                    Improve font selections on main screen : Times Roman instead of System.
                    (This also scales much better when the window is resized).
                    Store the INI settings file in the program's directory, 
                    rather that in the Windows' directory - there's enough 
                    crap there already ! ;)
                    Add in an "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" menu option to help
                    the user make this program run automatically at Windows Startup.
                    This saves you creating a shortcut to the program in the Windows
                    StartUp folder !!
                    In addition, if you move the program to a new directory or drive,
                    it will automatically sense that its existing auto-run command
                    needs updating to the program's new location.  Very cool !!
                    (8,447 lines of code / comments.)

4.1   11-Apr-2001   Add in support for "Big Fonts" and "Other Sized Fonts" - 
                    with these Windows resizes the windows automatically - 
                    but only sometimes and it doesn't always do it right, 
                    so now I make sure my main window is the right size 
                    before doing any scaling, etc.  i.e. I make it fit the 
                    component(s) that extend the furthest right and 
                    furthest down the form.   See the  Start Menu -> 
                    Settings -> Control Pannel -> Display -> Settings 
                    Tab -> "Advanced" button -> "General" tab for 
                    your PC's settings in this area.
                    Bring program up-to-date with my latest code libraries.
                    (9,417 lines of code / comments.)

4.2   20-Oct-2001   Add a "Sound Test" button to the CPU Usage Drop Alarm screen.
                    (Just so people can hear what the sound is like).
                    Add in the following File Menu options :
                    - Snap Program to Top Right of Screen
                    - Snap Program to Bottom Right of Screen
                    - Snap Program to Top Left of Screen
                    - Snap Program to Bottom Left of Screen
                    - Keep Program Inside the Screen Bounds
                    which make the program automatically control its position
                    no matter what screen resolutions changes you make.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Brand New About Screen and associated functionality.
                    Add in support for the Maximise icon in the top right 
                    corner of the program's main window.
                    (10,447 lines of code / comments.)

4.3  5-Feb-2002     Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Introduce yet more Anti-Hacker / Anti-Cracker measures.
                    (11,904 lines of code / comments.)

4.4  14-June-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Fix the PC speaker beeping under Windows XP / 2000.
                    (Nobody has reported this problem, and I only found out 
                    about this when I upgraded to Windows XP last weekend).
                    Add in a slider so the user can set the frequency of the beeping,
                    and add in a Wold Whistle and Sliding Scale sound effects options. 
                    (These options are only available under Windows NT, 2000, XP, etc).
                    (PC Speaker Beeping is used in the CPU Usage Drop Alarm 
                     functionality, and it is now fixed and improved under 
                     Windows NT / XP / 2000).
                    (22,882 lines of code / comments.)

4.5  23-July-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Add in a graph for Average CPU Usage for this run of the program.
                    Add in a "Reset CPU Monitoring" menu option - especially for 
                    Windows 95 / 98 users.  Sometimes, the CPU monitoring seems to 
                    get itself snagged up and keeps reporting values in the 90% range.
                    This only happens very rarely and only happens under Windows 95 / 98 
                    - I have never seen it happen under Windows NT or XP.
                    (Added especially for Bruce C).
                    (22,959 lines of code / comments.)

4.5b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (40,772 lines of code / comments.)

4.6   21-June-2003  Add in Mouse Odometer functionality - which is exactly the 
                    same as the "Mouse Odometer" program on my web site.
                    (** Registered Users Only **).
                    You can choose to display a Mouse Odometer or not - the 
                    default is to display the odometer.
                    The Mouse Odometer keeps count of your left anbd right 
                    mouse button clicks and the distance your mouse pointer 
                    travels (in Kilometers or Miles) - you choose which units 
                    you like.
                    You can also load the mouse distance and click details from 
                    the settings saved by my Mouse Odometer program, or save 
                    these values to file for use by my Mouse Odometer program.
                    (I always run Ram / Swap and Mouse Odometer at Windows startup
                    and merging this functionality into a single program saves 
                    about 2 MB of memory - a very small saving on today's PCs with 
                    256+ MB of RAM - but this saving could be useful on old PCs).
                    Improve the CPU Usage Drop Alarm functionality.
                    If a CPU Usage Drop Alarm is already in progress, then warn the
                    user if they attempt to start another CPU Usage Drop Alarm.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (59,047 lines of code / comments.)

4.7   30-June-2003  Add in support for all of the various Windows
                    Regional Settings for floating point numbers. 
                    i.e. Allow people to use something other than a 
                    full stop as the decimal point, and something 
                    other than a comma as a 1,000's separator.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code 
                    libraries.
                    (59,111 lines of code / comments.)

4.8   23-Jan-2004   Add in the "Reset Average CPU Usage" option under the "File" menu, to
                    force the program to restart average CPU usage calculations.
                    Add in "Disk Information" button and dialog - next to the drive space
                    monitoring section of the main window.
                    Fix the CPU Usage Drop Alarm - was this ever broken or was I just doing 
                    some testing / mucking around ??  In any case, it's fixed.
                    (60,026 lines of code / comments.)

4.8f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.

5.0f  4-Jan-2015    WOW, nearly 8 years since I've updated this program.  :)
                    Fix an issue with this program running under 64 bit versions of 
                    Windows Vista, 7, 8, etc.  (Auto-run at Windows startup).
                    Change the CPU Usage Drop alarm from the PC Speaker to an embedded sound (WAV) file,
                    because modern PCs no longer have a speaker.  All sound now comes via the 
                    sound device / speakers.
                    Flash the program's titlebar in the Windows Taskbar's when the CPU Usage Drop alarm
                    goes off (as well as playing the sound).  When the CPU Usage Drop alarm goes off, 
                    the sound keeps playing over and over again until the OK button is clicked.
                    Fix memory (RAM) and Swap File space reported under 64 bit versions of Windows
                    with memories much larger than 4 GB.
                    This program now supports memory (RAM) sizes, file sizes, and disk drive sizes 
                    well into the trillions of Zetta Bytes range (unless there is a bug I don't know 
                    about in the pascal compiler I am using).  Wish I had a 100 ZB drive to test against.  :)
                    1 ZB = 1,000,000,000,000 TB.  Given that current hard-drive sizes max out at
                    about 6 TB, we wont be getting to ZB drive sizes for a little while yet !  :)
                    Change over to using 1000 bytes for a KB as per the "standard".  I hate doing this.  
                    1 KB should be 1024 bytes, not 1000 bytes.  But I refuse to use the stupid looking 
                    "KiB" abbreviation for 1024 bytes.  Stupid standards committees !
                    To avoid feeling ill, I'll just have to "avert my eyes" when I get to the part 
                    of my code that says "1 KB = 1000 bytes".  :/
                    Completely re-design / re-vamp the user interface.
                    Change the old "oval Pie Chart" guages for RAM and Swap to standard (and boring) 
                    "bar graph" guages.  I remember 6 or so years ago someone sent me a very angry and 
                    highly abusive email because these 2 guages weren't circular.  Ummm, they were never  
                    meant to be circular dude !  I liked the elipses. LOL.  :)
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.  :)
                    (1,655  lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (68,308 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all primary, library, and include files.)

5.1f  4-Jan-2015    Add right-mouse click popup context sensitive menus to the CPU, Disk Space,
                    and Mouse sections.
                    Display a little speaker icon between the CPU Usage and Average CPU Usage bar 
                    graphs when the CPU Usage Drop Alarm is active.  (Prior to this, a little 
                    radio button was displayed in the top left corner of the CPU groupbox,  
                    but this was not as attractive as the little speaker icon).
                    (1,737  lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (68,538 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all primary, library, and include files.)

5.2f  16-Jan-2015   Add exception handling to the loading and saving of program settings (INI file)
                    so that the program executes and exits cleanly (no error messages produced) even 
                    if running from a read-only device such as a optical disk (CD-ROM, etc) or 
                    there are disk errors or the disk is full and/or the INI file does not exist 
                    and/or it cannot be created.
                    (1,772  lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (68,584 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all primary, library, and include files.)
