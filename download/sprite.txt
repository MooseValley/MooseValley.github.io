Sprite v0.6 (Oct 1995) for DOS.            by Moose O'Malley

FREE Ware !

This is an old Prototype of a 2D DOS based Graphics game I 
was working on a while ago.

The control keys are :

	A 		= Move Left
	S 		= Stop
	D 		= Move right
	Space Bar 	= Shoot
	ESC		= Quit

This program is my FIRST real exploration into 2D sprite games !

I wrote this program at a time when I was desperate to get into
SERIOUS game programming.  (Actually, I still am !!)

With "Character" based games like Tetris, Columns, and Blaster
behind me, I really wanted to get into "graphics" based games, and
2D sprite based games were a good place to start.

I searched bookshops, and the only books I found on 
"game programming" were for C / C++.  No good for me !!

So, in the absence of any books on Game Programming, and in
the absence of any manuals / books / help on Turbo Pascal v5,
I set about coding this game.  Am I a masochist or what !!

This early version of the game demonstrates :
- my 2D graphics engine, which can move any number 
  of sprites on screen, each with different numbers 
  of frames of animation, each of different sizes, 
  of different movement speeds, of different animation 
  frame change speed, and each moving in 
  different directions.
  (All in all, I was quite happy with this flexible engine).
- the screen wrapping, etc is correctly working.
- the sprites can pass over a background / bitmap without 
  disturbing it or erasing it.

Later on I was going to add :
- collision detection, 
- scoring, 
- decent sprites - the current sprites themselves are 
  simple shapes built out of lines / circles.
- improve speed control, so the ships don't speed up / slow
  down when there are less / more ships on screen.
- improve the draw sprite / erase sprite routines so
  that the sprites don't flash.

but, I haven't got round to this yet.

Basically, this game will go no further.  My next game will
be a Windows game, and will be written (most likely) in
Delphi.

So, this is only a *very* early prototype.

It is FREE Ware, and you can copy, distribute, and 
use it freely as long as this message remains intact.

It will run under Windows 3.1, 95, NT, but as a DOS application.

This program was written in Turbo Pascal v5 (DOS).
