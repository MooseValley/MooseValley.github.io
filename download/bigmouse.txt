Introduction :
--------------

Big Mouse Pointer for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, ME, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Big Mouse Pointer is a program that simply enables you to use 
a BIG arrow (of just about any size and color) as the mouse pointer.

Big Mouse Pointer enables you to specify a mouse pointer of just
about any size from :
- None (Standard Windows Mouse Pointer only).
- Miniscule (2-3 times the size of the standard Windows mouse pointer)
- Tiny
- Small
- Medium
- Large
- Huge
- Mammoth
- Gigantic 
- Don't be Stupid !!! (which fills up half of the screen).

The smaller pointers do work better, and the larger pointers
are mainly for novelty value.

The size of the mouse pointers are all resolution independent.
So, if you choose "Large" on a VGA 640x480 screen, then the mouse 
pointer will be roughly the same size as if you used the program
with a "Large" pointer on a 1600x1200 SVGA or 100x100 LCD screen.

When you run this program, it resides in the Windows Traybar
(in the tray area with the clock, etc).

If you want to change the size and/or colour of the mouse pointer, 
simply click on the program's icon in the Windows Tray Bar, and, 
when the main program window appears, select the new size 
or colour.

The menu options on the main window enable you to :
- Auto-Run the Program when Windows Starts Up.
- Restore Factory Defaults

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.
This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Why I Wrote this Program :
--------------------------

I do a lot of presentations and lecturers (at the moment, I am working 
as a full time lecturer at a university in Australia), and one thing 
that people sometimes comment on is that they find it hard to see the 
standard Windows mouse cursor on the massive wall screen projection, 
which can result in two things : 
1. People lose time trying to find the mouse pointer so they know which 
   part of a presentation slide I am currently commenting on.  
2. And, this means that they can miss out on key facts and discussion 
   during the presentation.

Also, when you work on computers *alot* (as I do - at home and work - 
my whole life is basically my computers, which I tend to eat, sleep, 
and breathe), it can get a little hard towards the end of a long 
day to find the mouse pointer.  If you need to hunt for it, then 
you can lose your train of thought, and lose momentum in your work.

Also, on Laptop / LCD screens, it can be next to impossible to find the
mouse cursor, especially in bright light conditions.

Finally, when you work at very high resolutions (1600 x 1200, or even 
1280 x 1100), then the standard Windows Mouse pointer is almost 
microscopic, and can be very hard to see / find.

To prevent these problems / issues, I needed a program to provide me 
with a decent sized mouse pointer, that would work with monitors
of any resolution - even 1 billion pixels x 1 billion pixels.

Since I love programming, then I simply sat down one weekend and 
thought about this topic, and ended up writing this program.


Know Issues / Problems :
------------------------

This program is great, but it is not perfect, and it has several 
limitations, as follows :

1. When you have a big mouse pointer, and hold the mouse cursor 
   over a button or icon that has tooltips, then the tooltips can
   be obscured or covered up by the big mouse pointer.

2. In addition, when I used Big Mouse Pointer with some programs, 
   and selected text with the mouse (i.e. I clicked and dragged with 
   the mouse to highlight text) in the program, then artifact pointers 
   appeared on the screen until I released the mouse button.  
   (i.e. stopped dragging).   The artifacts were only very temporary 
   and caused absolutely no harm at all - they just look wierd ...
   As soon as the mouse button was released, the artifacts dissapeared.
   N.B.  The standard Windows mouse pointer does this as well, but
   it is a lot more noticeable when you have a big mouse pointer !

3. When the screen saver is on, the mouse pointer remains
   visible.

4. When you select the biggest mouse pointer, which takes up most of the
   screen and isn't really meant to be taken seriously anyway, then
   when you move it, it can be a little flickery / jerky depending 
   on the speed of your video card and cpu.

5. When your PC is busy and you move the mouse, then artifact pointers 
   may temporarily appear on the screen until your PC has had a chance
   to refresh its display.

These issues may be looked at / fixed / improved in the future.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Other mouse pointer shapes.
- Flashing mouse pointer arrow.
- Colour cycling mouse pointer arrow.
- Look at / fix / improve some of the above "Know Issues / Problems".
  (Particularly the screen saver one).
- Hide the real mouse cursor - maybe ?  (I this being available though
  as it helps you understand context when you hold the mouse over a button
  or an edit box or other windows controls.  e.g. can you enter data into 
  an edit box, can you drag and drop files, is a control available, etc.
- Anything else ?

If you would like any improvements, or would like to
suggest any improvements, please email me and let me know.

As with all of my shareware programs, how much more work I do on 
this program depends entirely on what support I get, how many 
people use the program, etc.

Amendment History :
--------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0   6-Apr-2001    First Public Release.
                    (9,090 lines of code / comments.)

1.1  13-Nov-2001    Remove some experimental code that I was working on
                    to test if the screen saver is currently active,
                    and turning off the Big Mouse pointer if it was.
                    This was making the Big Mouse pointer invisible always
                    on some systems.  Special thanks to Christine T for 
                    reporting this problem to me earlier on today.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Brand New About Screen and associated functionality.
                    Add in support for the Maximise icon in the top right 
                    corner of the program's main window.
                    (10,035 lines of code / comments.)

1.2  13-Nov-2001    Add in a new massive size of mouse pointer called
                    jokingly "Don't be Stupid !!!" because it's so 
                    ridiculously big.
                    Fix an error where the mouse pointer was not restored
                    if you chose "No Mouse Pointer" and then selected another
                    mouse pointer.
                    (10,083 lines of code / comments.)

1.3  5-Feb-2002     Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Introduce yet more Anti-Hacker / Anti-Cracker measures.
                    (11,288 lines of code / comments.)

1.4  14-June-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Add in a 0.5 second delay when you change the mouse pointer 
                    size to give the program and windows time to adjust to the new 
                    form size.  Prior to adding this delay, you could go bezerk, and 
                    click on many changes in size a second, and this could cause 
                    problems when the mouse pointer didn't have time to redraw and 
                    resize between the size changes.  The delay solves this problem.
                    (20,409 lines of code / comments.)

1.4b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    Registered Users - please contact me via email.
                    (35,034 lines of code / comments.)

1.4f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.
