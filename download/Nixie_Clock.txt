Introduction :
--------------

Nixie Clock is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Nixie Clock is a "for fun" program that displays a re-sizable
clock made out of images of Nixie Tube digits.

The program currently has the following digit styles 
available :
- Valvo ZM1000 Nixie Tubes
- Z568M Nixie Tubes
- Red and Green LED clock digits
- Unknown Nixie Type
- ZM1020 Round Nixie Tubes

More digits / styles will be made available in future versions 
of this program.  (If you have a set of images for each digit
- then please email them to me, and I will add them into 
the program).

I would particularly like to add the following images this 
program :
- Burroughs B7971 alphanumeric nixie tubes
- East German Z856 nixie tubes
- and others

The normal Windows style menus are turned off in this program
(so they don't detract from the clock), however, everything 
can be accessed via a right mouse click popup menu.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
--------------------------

I wrote this program because my electronics genius, super 
geek brother, Francis, got me interested in Nixie Clocks
several months ago.  ;))

Sadly, what I know about electronics can be written on 
the back of a postage stamp (leaving plenty of room for 
glue and lickin' !! ;), so building such a real hardware 
Nixie Tube clock for me is pretty much out of the question 
at the moment.

However, developing computer software is something I
know very well and thoroughly enjoy, so I developed a
software based Nixie Clock instead.

Unlike the hardware based Nixie Clocks, this software
one will never wear out.

*** Valvo ZM1000 Nixie Tube Images :

The initial set of Valvo ZM1000 Nixie Tube digits 
were obtained from a on-line Nixie Clock WEB site :

	http://www.fortunecity.de/wolkenkratzer/westend/696/nixieclock/nixstart.htm

The "colon" Valvo ZM1000 Nixie Tube image was created 
by me by hand editing the digit 0.

I also hand edited the images to create a Red set of
Nixie tubes as well.

Electronics Purists probably consider both of these 
activities to be sacrilidge ...  ;)


*** Z568M Nixie Tube Images :

The Z568M Nixie Tube images were obtained from the
Giant Nixie Clock WEB Page :

	http://www.hanssummers.com/electronics/clocks/nixie/


*** LED Digits :

The Red and Green LED clock digits were created by me 
from scratch.  (I have actually created complete sets of 
5 different styles of LEDs - but included with the program 
are what I consider to be the best style).


*** Unknown Nixie Type :

Were contained in a GIF animation that was on a WEB site somewhere.
(I have retraced my steps trying to find the WEB site again, but 
have not been successful yet.  If anyone knows about these Nixie 
Tubes, please email me and let me know).  I extracted the frames 
out, touched up them images, and made them into an animation strip 
and loaded them into my Nixie Clock program.


- ZM1020 Round Tubes Image

These images were originally obtained from a GIF animation on 
Peter H. Wendt's Nixie Clock Project web page :

	http://www.fortunecity.de/wolkenkratzer/westend/696/nixieclock/nixstart.htm

The images required extensive editing and touching up.  I extracted 
the frames out, and then did extensive editing and touching up 
and manually edited each digit (there was a strange blue background 
on the digits, the bottom half of the round Nixie "button" was truncated, 
and they were all damaged due to resolution reduction and colour 
reduction).  However, after a couple of hours of hand-editing, they 
were in infinitely better shape (but still far from perfect).  
I then made them into an animation strip and loaded them into my 
Nixie Clock program.


Special thanks also go to these pages for inspiring 
this project :

Nixie Clock Gallery

	http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~wwl/electric.html

Cathode Corner

and especially to my brother Francis for letting me know
about these cool Nixie clocks and tubes, and inspiring me to 
create this program.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\Clock\ - and run the executable 
file : Nixie_Clock.EXE.

You can also drag and drop shortcuts to this program
onto your Desktop or Start Menu using Windows Explorer.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu
in the program.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete Nixie Clock
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !

(Before deleting the program, you should turn off 
the auto-running of this program under Windows - 
if you have previously enabled it.  See the menu 
option under the "File" menu in the program to 
achieve this - or righ-mouse click and choose 
the option from the pop-up menu).


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Add more digits.

- Add more types of tubes.

- The ability to display the date as well.

- The ability to create and/or use your own digits.

- Maintain Aspect Ratio - so you cannot get digits that
  are stretched too far out of shape when you re-size the  
  Nixie Clock's main window.

- Automatically Resize Nixie Clock's main window to suit the
  digits being displayed.  e.g. resize for optimal viewing 
  conditions (size), aspect ratio, etc.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------

None so far.
