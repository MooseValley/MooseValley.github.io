Introduction :
--------------

SciFiComputer 1950s Simulator runs under the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM).

SciFiComputer 1950s Simulator is stupid little program - it is my
lame attempt at simulating a 1950 Sci Fi movie computer - which
had a matrix of flashing lights but didn't do much.  My program
is the same - a matrix of flashing lights but doesn't do anything
useful.  :)  It is just flashing lights.  Ummm, OK ?  :)

I've released some cookie software onto my web page over the
past 20+ years, but this is right up there with the cookiest
- and the most useless !!  :)

This software will run on ANY operating system that is capable of
running the JVM, including desktops, laptops, and tablets running
Windows, Linux, Unix, etc, such as PCs, Macs, Raspberry PI, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company,
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.


Using this Program :
--------------------

Download and install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for
your machine / OS (if it is not already installed on your machine):

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Extract the contents of the SciFiComputer_1950s zip file you
downloaded my my web site to a folder on your machine.

And then, double click on:

	SciFiComputer_1950s.jar

icon / file to run the game in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

There's no labelled buttons, no menus, no labels, and it is not
user friendly, it's not meant to be - this is a 1950's
SciFi computer simulator !

These is no real user interface - but some of the buttons in the grid do
"interesting" things:

* The 9 (nine) leftmost, top row grid buttons change the colour scheme.
The "CS" value in the title bar shows the colour scheme number.
Default CS: 0 = black and white.

* The 2nd row grid buttons change the maximum random number of seconds
between random colour scheme changes.  If you don't want any colour scheme
changes, click the left most leftmost, 2nd row button.
The "V" value in the title bar shows the maximum random number of seconds
between random colour scheme changes.
Default V: 0 = no random colour scheme changes.

* The 3rd row grid buttons change the maximum random number of seconds between
grid refreshes.  If you don't want grid refreshes, click the
left most leftmost, 3rd row button.
The "R" value in the title bar shows the maximum random number of seconds
between grid refreshes.
Default R: 0 = no random grid refreshes.

* The top right grid button, and 4 bottom right corner grid buttons show
a simple About screen.

Enjoy ! :)


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Allow user to change grid size.

- Round grid buttons instead of square / rectangular.

- Monitor CPU usage and change grid cell colours faster
  when CPU usage is higher.

- Coalesce grid to form random words ?

- Ummmm .... anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.
