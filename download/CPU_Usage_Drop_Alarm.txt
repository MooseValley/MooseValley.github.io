Introduction :
--------------

CPU Usage Drop Alarm is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, netbooks, 
etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which includes 
Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

CPU Usage Drop Alarm provides "CPU Usage Drop alarm"  functionality.
When activated (by clicking the "Activate" button) this functionality 
plays a sound over and over again until the user clicks the OK button 
when the CPU usage drops below a user specified level for a user 
specified number of seconds.  

This is very useful for telling you when a big job has ended, 
such as a Virus Scan, Disk Scan, Disk Defragment, CD/DVD Burning, 
video processing and conversions, etc.

This is the same functionality that is provided in some of my other 
software titles (such as RAM / Swap Monitor), but this program provides 
additional features.  For example, you can select whether the CPU Usage 
being monitored is the Average, Minimum, or Maximum CPU Usage across 
all of the CPUs in your computer.

This is useful because you may be running a single threaded application (an 
application that uses only 1 CPU), and if you want to know when this finishes 
its processing / work, then you could monitor the Maximum CPU usage across all CPUs, 
rather than the Average across all CPUs.

If you select Average, then the number of CPUs is displayed next to the graph.
e.g. 'Avg 8xCPU' will be displayed if you have 8 CPUs.

If you select Minimum, then the ID of the CPU that had the minimum usage and the 
number of CPUs is displayed next to the graph.  e.g. 'CPU.3/8' will be displayed 
if CPU 3 of 8 had the minimum load.

If you select Maximum, then the ID of the CPU that had the maximum usage and the 
number of CPUs is displayed next to the graph.  e.g. 'CPU.3/8' will be displayed 
if CPU 3 of 8 had the maxiumum load.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, simply run it and change the settings to suit your needs
and click the "Activate" button.

If you want this program to be "Always On Top" of other Windows, 
then select the "Always On Top" menu option under the "File" menu.


Why is this useful ?  /  Why do this ?
--------------------------------------

The functionality provided by this program is very useful if your PC 
is performing Virus Scan, Disk Scan, Disk Defragment, CD/DVD Burning, 
video processing and conversions, etc, and you want to be alerted when 
the processing has been completed (via a sound played over and over again).

This saves you having to hang around your PC watching it and waiting for it 
to complete the work you have assigned.  You can go away, have a coffee, etc
and as long as you are within ear shot of the sound, you will be alerted when 
the processing has been completed.
