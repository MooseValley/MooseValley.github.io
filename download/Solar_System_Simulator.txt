Introduction :
--------------

Solar System Simulator is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, netbooks, 
etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which includes 
Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Solar System Simulator is a program to help you visualise 
the solar system, compare the planets, and find out more 
about the planets.

Solar System Simulator includes :

- An animation of the Solar System, with the planets rotating 
  around the Sun.  You can adjust the speed of this rotation - 
  so that all planets move slowly, or so that some or all 
  planets whiz around the Sun.

  You can reverse, forwards, pause, re-start, and reset the 
  action at any time.

  You can also choose which planet to "stand on" and the 
  perspective of the rotating planets and Sun is adjusted 
  accordingly.

  And, you can also trace the orbit of each object - i.e. draw
  a white dot at the center of each object at each position.
  This is great for helping to visualize / understrand the 
  various orbits.

- 46 Planetary Comparison Graphs (with various options) to 
  let you compare dozens of crit

  You can include the Sun in these graphs if you want, or 
  you can include or exclude the Jovian Planets (Jupiter,
  Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), or change various other 
  options.

- You can view the actual values / numbers, or scale the 
  values releative to Earth.
  This makes it easier to visualise the data.  For example, instead of
  seeing the Planet Radius values for each planet (Earth 6,371 Km, 
  Saturn 58,232 Km, etc) you see the sizes relative to Earth 
  (Saturn has 9.14 Earth's radius).

- Planet Statistics and information, with complete detailed
  reports on each planet or our Sun - including size, mass,
  length of day, temperature ranges, density, volume, 
  surface area, orbital velocity, space craft visits, and 
  many dozens of other measurements, statistics, and 
  interesting facts.

- A Weight Calculator to enable you to enter your weight 
  and calculate your weight on each planet.

- Extract Data: you can copy and paste any or all selected 
  "extracted  data" into a spreadsheet or your own reports.  
  The data is generated in "TAB separated" format to make 
  it easy to do these things.  You can copy ALL data 
  values for ALL planets to Windows clipboard with 3 
  mouse clicks !!  (Simply click on the "Select All" 
  button, "Extract Data" button, and finally the 
  "Copy to Windows' Clipboard" button - 2 seconds is 
  all it takes !!)

- Gravity Calculator: allows you to enter the mass and volume 
  of an object relative to Earth, and calculate the object's 
  gravity.  This works perfectly for all asteronomical objects, 
  including stars, Neutron Stars, Black Holes, planets and moons 
  in our solar system, and exo-planets (planets around other stars).

All data (including the reports and graphs !) can be copied 
to Windows Clipboard at the click of a button, so that you can 
then paste them into your own documents and use them in your 
own projects / research / web pages / etc.

You can generate a highly detailed report on all planets
with 2 mouse clicks !!  (Select "All Objects" on the 
"Planet Statistics" tab, and press the "Copy to Windows 
Clipboard" button - simple !)

If you do use this information or the reports or graphs in
your own own projects / research / web pages / etc, then 
please provide a link to my WEB page.

All data has been checked against official NASA figures,
see "Accuracy of the Data Presented" below.

This program should be useful to anyone who wants to 
learn more about the Solar System.

As far as I can tell, this program is unique - after 
carrying out extensive searching on the internet and 
in magazines, I can find no other program like it in 
the world !!  (At least, this was the case when the 
program was developed - there are probably copy cat 
rip-offs out there now ...  ;)

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed).


Why I wrote this program ?
--------------------------------------------

I wrote this program because I have always been interested
in space and space travel.

This program is a program I have wanted to have for ages,
but nothing quite like it exists as far as I can determine.


Accuracy of the Data Presented :
--------------------------------

I used many sources to obtain the data that is 
used in this program : 

- Many internet sites, especially these excellent sites :

  Planetary Fact Sheet - Metric
   http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/index.html

  NASA Planets and Missions information, and great fact sheets :
    http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/
    http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planetfact.html

  Enchanted Learning :
    http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/

  The Planetary Society :
    http://www.planetary.org/learn/solarsystem/index.html

  Solar Views :
    http://www.solarviews.com/eng/toc.htm

  Solar Space Station :
    http://www.solarspace.co.uk/index.html

- Various books on space,

- Planets DVDs (the awesome 6 x 1 hour BBC series), 

- Sam Neil's Space DVD (another awesome 
  BBC series - this time it's 3 hours long), 

- Encylopeadia Britanica DVD (a real piece of crap !! - 
  a $200 waste of money !), 

- And various other sources.

There was, however, a lot of variation in the figures
these sources presented.

For example, there were variations in the figures 
presented for the diameters, temperatures, distances 
from the Sun, masses, etc for almost every planet I.

I racked my brains and pulled my hair when I found such 
variations - and there were many dozens of such variations.

However, I ended up always believing NASA's figures.

Compiling this information and checking it against
multiple sources to verify every single figure has
been a *MAJOR* piece of work for me - requiring many 
long nights and weekends.

When I found such variations, I made a decision
to trust what looked like the most up-to-date source
of information (i.e. NASA).

In addition, it was also very hard to determine some 
values.  For example, the atmospheric pressure of 
Jupiter, or the temperature ranges on the Jovian 
Planets, etc, as this information simply isn't 
known yet.  (More Space Probes are needed !)

If anyone finds any errors in any values presented 
in the program, then please make sure that you have 
the latest version of the program.  (i.e. download 
this from my web page - see below).

In addition, you should double and triple check your data
against NASA Planets information fact sheets :

  http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planetfact.html

as I assume that NASA should be the most reliable source
of information.

If you are using the latest version of the program,
and you still believe that this has errors 
(i.e. discrepancies with the official NASA figures) 
and you are sure that your units and numbers are correct, 
then please email me and let me know, 
what values you think are wrong and why, and what the 
correct values should be.  

I will then look at things and check things out, and 
if I can confirm the errors, then I will fix these 
and prepare a new version of the program.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\Planets\ - and run the executable 
file : Solar_System_Simulator.EXE.

You can also drag and drop shortcuts to this program
onto your Desktop or Start Menu using Windows Explorer.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu
in the program.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete Solar System Simulator  
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !


Glossary of Terms :
-------------------

I assume that people know what radius, volume, circumference,
and other basic terms mean.  Here are the meanings of 
some of the more advanced / interesting terms.

Albedo :
An object's albedo is the ratio of the amount of solar 
radiation reflected by it to the total amount it 
receives.  i.e. the albedo is a measure of an object's 
reflectiveness.  An object with a high albedo is shinier 
than an object with a low albedo.  A white, highly 
reflective object has an albedo of 1.0, while a black object 
with no reflectivity has an albedo of 0.

Distance - Closest Possible Distance between Planet and Earth :
For planets beyond the orbit of Earth, this is when 
Earth is furthest from the Sun and the planet is closest 
to the Sun and on the same side of the Sun as Earth.

Distance - Maximum Possible Distance between Planet and  Earth :
When Earth is furthest from the Sun and the planet is furthest 
from the Sun but on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth.

Ecliptic :
The ecliptic is the plane of Earth's orbit about the Sun.

Ellipticity :
The flattening of a planet as a result of its fast 
rotation.

Escape Velocity :
Initial velocity, in Km/Sec, needed at the surface (at the 
1 bar pressure level for the gas giants) to escape the 
body's gravitational pull forever, ignoring atmospheric drag.

Obliquity to Orbit :
The object's axial tilt in degrees.

Orbital Eccentricity :
How Elliptic the object's orbit is.  0 = perfectly circular 
orbit, higher values mean more elliptical orbits.

Orbital Inclination :
How far off the Ecliptic (i.e. the plane of the Earth's orbit 
of the Sun) that the planets orbits the Sun - in degrees.

Roche Limit :
The Roche limit is the distance from the center of a star 
or other object at which a large orbiting object will break 
up due to tidal (gravitational) forces.  Large planets or 
moons cannot orbit within the Roche limit - because they will 
break up.  The Roche Limit was identified and invented by 
Edouard Roche in 1848.

Solar Day :
A solar day is the amount of time that passes between two subsequent 
times when the Sun reaches its highest position above the horizon 
(passing through the meridian).  The solar day varies greatly throughout 
the year, so the mean solar day is used instead.  This is calculated as 
the average of all of the solar days in one year.  A solar day on Earth 
is exactly 24 hours (since this is how we define hour, as 1/24 of a day).  
A solar day is slightly longer than a sidereal day.  

Sidereal Day (Period of Rotation) : 
A sidereal day is the time it takes for the Earth to rotate on 
its axis relative to the stars - not the sun.  Because planets move in 
their orbits abpout the sun as they rotate, then the sidereal day is 
not the same as a solar day.

Solar Irradiance :
The amount of sun light reaching the planet.

Sphere of Influence :
Is the area around an object in which it's gravity is 
the dominant force.

The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- More accurate plotting of the orbits of planets - at the moment
  all orbits are circular, which is perfectly acceptable - at 
  the scale presented - for all planets except Pluto - which should
  have an elliptical orbit which moves the it closer to the Sun
  than Neptune for 20 years out of its 248.5 year orbit.

- Optimise the animations - improve the speed - especially on slow 
  machines.  e.g. old laptops with crappy / slow on-board graphics.

- On 21-Apr-2005, Egil Larsen requested :

	The only thing missing which would be fun is to be able to input 
	a date and see the relational position of the planets for that 
	date, but if I'm not mistaken this is way out of scope for the 
	program.

  At this stage, this is a little outside the scope for the program 
  as it stands.  I will need to do a lot more research and think about 
  things carefully (and probably buy several books) before I can work 
  out how to do this.

  A few registrations will need to start coming in as well.  ;)

- More animation options.

- More information :
  * Crust composition.  e.g. percentage of iron, aluminium, carbon, etc.

- More comparissons.

- More Animations.

- Sound effects.

- More images of the Planets.

- Frequently Asked Questions

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, 
what kind of feedback I get, etc.

Amendment History :
-------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0  04-Oct-2002    First Public Release.
                    (28,952 lines of code / comments.)

1.1  11-Oct-2002    Add Data Extraction functionality - so users can extract 
                    all or selected data item values for each planet.
                    When a menu is clicked, stop the planet animation - this helps
                    on slow PCs - e.g. Pentium 200's or less.
                    Add in more calls to 'Application.ProcessMessages' - which helps
                    make things smoother on older PCs - e.g. Pentium 200's or less.
                    Reduce the size / resolution of the nebula star field picture 
                    behind the planet animation - this improves performance on 
                    slow PCs - e.g. Pentium 200's or less.  This picture reduction 
                    also reduced the EXE size from 684 KB to 409 KB (a reduction 40%)
                    with corressponding savings in the distribution ZIP file 
                    download size.
                    Remove the Start button - it was redundant.  So now there are only 
                    Forward, Reverse, Stop and Reset buttons to control the animation 
                    of the planets.
                    Disable the "Maximize" icon - in the top right hand corner of 
                    the Title bar.  (The program's window is not re-sizable).
                    Make the program's window fit neatly on a screen with a 
                    800 x 600 resolution or higher - any PC purchased after
                    the early 1990's should be capable of this.
                    Add in calculations behind the scenes for :
                    - Orbit_Ellipse_Semi_Major_Axis_Length
                    - Orbit_Ellipse_Semi_Minor_Axis_Length
                    - Orbit_Ellipse_Center
                    Click on the graph to move to the Next Graph.
                    (29,264 lines of code / comments.)

2.0  14-Oct-2002    Add in calculations for :
                    - Roche_Limit
                    - Sphere_of_Influence
                    - Length of Solar Day
                    and add in graphs for this information, and add these to the 
                    reports for each planet.
                    Allow the user to select the Origin - on the fly !!
                    e.g. If you select Jupiter, then you will see what the rotation 
                    of the planets and Sun looks like from Jupiter's perspective.  
                    i.e. as if you were standing on the surface of Jupiter and 
                    looking up and watching the planets.
                    Add in buttons to increase and decrease the speed of animation.
                    Hand edit and improve the quality of the planet bitmaps.
                    Generate the small planet images (used for animations) on the 
                    fly when the program starts to save holding these in the 
                    EXE - which helped reduce the EXE size slightly.
                    Add a "Glossary of Terms" into this text file.
                    Use a new Sun bitmap - the old one looked like a Butternut Snap - 
                    one of my favourite biscuits - and this was making me hungry !! ;)
                    Actually, come to think of it, the new Sun looks like a 
                    pizza .... Hmmmm  ...  ;)
                    (31,517 lines of code / comments.)

2.1  2-Dec-2002     Add in data, calculations, graphs, and report lines for
                     - Distance_Closest_Possible_to_Earth
                     - Distance_Furthest_Possible_from_Earth
                    for each Planet.
                    Also report the Closest, Average, and Furthest distances from 
                    the Sun (and the Closest and Furthest distances between each 
                    Planet and the Earth) in Light Hours - the number of hours it 
                    takes light to travel the distance.
                    Use different timing loops / code during animation, and redesign
                    the planetary animation code.
                    The animation is now smoother on slower PCs.  e.g. Pentium 100.
                    Add the ability to trace the orbit of each object.
                    Add File Menu options to enable the user to create or delete 
                    shortcuts to this program on the Desktop, StartMenu, etc - 
                    you can do this *ANY* time - not just when the program is 
                    being installed.  (All Windows programs should provide this 
                    functionality).
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (50,414 lines of code / comments.)

2.2  25-Aug-2003    Add the ability to trace the orbits of selected planets
                    and be able to change this on-the-fly.
                    Display the Frames per Second on animation.
                    Add in "Animation Speed Benchmarks" above.
                    Add in additional images :
                     - The Relative Sizes of the Sun and the Planets 
                     - The Obliquity (Angle of Tilt) of the Planets 
                     - The Largest Moons and Smallest Planets
                    These images are used with permission of Calvin Hamilton 
                    which was received on 4-Oct-2002.   Check out Calvin's 
                    excellent Solar Views WEB Site : http://www.solarviews.com/
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (56,806 lines of code / comments.)

2.2f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.

2.3f 24-Oct-2009    The "Farewell Pluto / sorry Clive !" Release.
                    Some usability enhancements (can use left / right arrow keys 
                    to change graphs, etc).
                    Calculate the actual Gravity of each planet and the Sun using its 
                    mass and diameter (this data was hard-coded previously).
                    Calculate some other values that were hard-coded.
                    Increase Jupiter's moons to 63 (according to ABC Radio quiz), and
                    Saturn has 61 moons, Uranus has 27 moons, and Neptune has 13.
                    Remove Pluto as a planet.  On August 24, 2006, the International 
                    Astronomical Union (IAU) voted on the definition of a planet:
                    - orbit the sun and not another planet
                    - be massive enough to be spherical
                    - have cleared its orbit of debris
                    Pluto met the first 2 criteria but not the 3rd.  Since part of 
                    Pluto's orbit is in the Kuiper Belt, its orbit is not cleared 
                    of debris.  Pluto is now officially known as a "dawrf planet", 
                    and also sometimes called a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO).
                    Poor Clyde Tombaugh (the discoverer of Pluto) will be spinning 
                    in his grave.  At least they waited until after poor Clyde had 
                    passed away.  The decision still affected his family however, 
                    read this article:
                    http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1724550.htm
                    For over 3 years, I have resisted removing Pluto from my Solar 
                    System Simulator because I kept hoping the IAU would reverse 
                    their decision.  Sadly not.
                    I have made it so ALL of Pluto data is still there, and that 
                    it can easily be reinstated as a planet if this decision about 
                    Pluto changes in the future.  (Not holding my breath ...)
                    Reduce the default "Speed" of animation (the slider at the bottom).
		    Change the default of "Trace Orbits of Objects" to checked for all 
		    objects.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.

3.0f 13-Jan-2015    Lots of changes for this release.  :)
                    Add the ability to scale all graph values relative to Earth.
                    This makes it easier to visualise the data.  For example, instead of
                    seeing the Planet Radius values for each planet (Earth 6,371 Km, 
                    Saturn 58,232 Km, etc) you see the sizes relative to Earth 
                    (Saturn has 9.14 Earth's radius).
                    Add "First Graph" and "Last Graph" buttons so you can quickly navigate 
                    around the graphs.
                    Remove "Registered Version" message on the "Data Extraction" tab.
                    Replace images on "Sizes and Tilts" and "Moons and Dwarf Planets" tabs
                    with higher resolution images.  This makes the EXE slightly larger.
                    Update details for Pluto (add 4 newly discovered moons, etc).  
                    Although Pluto isn't "visible" in any of my program's graphs, etc, 
                    it is still there behind the scenes.
                    Fix an issue with this program running under 64 bit versions of 
                    Windows Vista, 7, 8, etc.  (Auto-run at Windows startup).
                    Fix the solar system / planetary animation under 64 bit versions of Windows: 
                    the problem was that the planets were NOT visible in the animation.
                    It turns out that this problem was caused by an AutoSize parameter for 
                    TImage components being handled differently under 64 bit versions of Windows:
                    * For 32 bit versions of Windows, if an image is copied to a blank TImage 
                      component with a specific size, then the size of the TImage does NOT change, 
                      even if it's AutoSize property is set to True.
                    * For 64 bit versions of Windows, the TImage size will be set to 0, and 0 pixels 
                      are copied, and this is why the planets were not showing up.
                    So, the behaviour of the TImage component completely changes depending on which 
                    version of Windows you are using.  I could NOT find any reference to this anywhere 
                    on the internet.  Very STRANGE and completely undocumented behaviour.  
                    The fix for this was *very* simple: set AutoSize to false for each of the 
                    planet TImages, and everything worked perfectly again.  :)
                    Fix a form sizing and scaling issue under 64 bit versions of Windows Vista, 
                    7, 8, etc - where the behaviour is, once again, completley different 
                    to 32 bit versions of Windows.
                    Thank you Microsoft - NOT ! - for continuing the to break and change things 
                    behind the scenes in Windows in completely unexpected ways !
                    Add a Gravity Calculator to the new "Gravity" tab which allows you to enter the mass and 
                    volume of an object relative to Earth or the Sun, and calculate the object's gravity.  
                    This works perfectly for all asteronomical objects, including stars, Neotron Stars, 
                    Black Holes, planets and moons in our solar system, and exo-planets (planets 
                    around other stars).  I added this functionality because I was reading some articles 
                    about exoplanets today, such as "HD 40307g".  The articles said this exoplanet had 
                    "eight times the mass of Earth and twice the volume" and that its "gravity will 
                    be a real killer for any human visitors".  None of the articles mentioned what the 
                    gravity was.  How strong was its gravity ?  Would it really kill humans ?  I decided 
                    to work out the answers to these questions.  So, I added the "Gravity" tab to my 
                    Solar System Simulator, added the required calculations, and within a minute or 2 
                    I had my answers: HD 40307g's Gravity = 49.50 m/sec^2, which is 5.04x Earth`s Gravity.
                    Now, this is strong gravity.  However, I have experienced more than 6 G for short periods 
                    (5-10 seconds or so at a time, but it felt like hours ! ;)  in an old Russian Mig fighter jet
                    and 5+G is not particularly comfortable, but it certainly wont kill you.  The author's 
                    claims of it being a "real killer for any human visitors" are clearly exaggerated.  
                    And who knows, eventually humans might learn / adapt to live under such strong gravity ?
                    Add "Animation Speed Benchmarks" for my most recently purchased computers:
                    * Laptop:  HP EliteBook (purchased early-2013)
                    * Desktop: HP Z220 Workstation (purchased mid-2013)
                    Add exception handling to the loading and saving of program settings (INI file)
                    so that the program executes and exits cleanly (no error messages produced) even 
                    if running from a read-only device such as a optical disk (CD-ROM, etc) or 
                    there are disk errors or the disk is full and/or the INI file does not exist 
                    and/or it cannot be created.
                    Explore using a Frame Skip method for the planetary animations in the Solar System Simulator 
                    tab, but this did not work as well as the currently implemented "Time Increment" 
                    method that I have been using all along.  I will explore this further though.
                    Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (4,350 lines of code / comments / blank lines in primary source file.)
                    (68,777 lines of code / comments / blank lines in all primary, library, and include files.)
