Introduction :
--------------

Full Screen Background is a simple little program that
creates a full screen "background" over your desktop
and any underlying applications that you want to hide.

Why is this useful ?  I'm often doing screen shots, live
demos, and recording desktop videos using tools like Camtasia
Studio, and I don't want to show / include the clutter of
my desktop icons, or show any material in any open documents
that I'd rather keep private, so I needed a program that I
could run and it will cover everything below it - no more
desktop clutter, no more private information revealed,
no more worries about prying eyes of strangers or "busy bodies"
walking by, etc.

So, I created Full Screen Background, and it has proven incredibly
useful to me.  Maybe someone else out there will also find it useful ?

This program will run on ANY operating system that is capable of
running the JVM, including desktops, laptops, and tablets running
Windows, Linux, Unix, etc, such as PCs, Macs, Raspberry PI, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company,
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.


Using this Program :
--------------------

Download and install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for
your machine / OS (if it is not already installed on your machine):

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Extract the contents of the FullScreenBackground.zip file you
downloaded from my web site to a folder on your machine.

And then, double click on:

	FullScreenBackground.jar

icon / file to run the program in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Right mouse click on the screen to access the popup menu
to change colours, see ther About screen, and Exit the
application.

Create a shortcut to FullScreenBackground on your Desktop
so it is ready when you need it.  :)

Run FullScreenBackground and then access your applications
from the taskbar and click on their icons to bring them
to the top, and click their icons again to minimize them.

Use Windows Hotkeys:
* Alt-TAB to switch applications and bring them to the front.
* Ctrl_Esc to show the Start Menu so you can run apps, and
  also reveal the Taskbar so you can select apps to bring
  to the front.
* etc.


Use Cases: Why Use This Program? Why I wrote this program?
----------------------------------------------------------

FullScreenBackground is very useful if you are:
1. recording desktop videos (Camtasia Studio, etc).
2. taking screen shots.
3. doing live demos, etc.

and you want a clean computer screen - i.e. you don't want to
show / include the clutter of my desktop icons, or show any
material in any open documents that you would rather keep
private, then Full Screen Background is just what you need.

4. Also FullScreenBackground is very useful if you want to
make screen shots or recordings of your apps / work, but
you don't want to have the desktop icons, writing in
background windows, etc showing through - bleeding through -
and causing artifacts in transparent title bars and borders.

5. FullScreenBackground would also be useful if you
want to green screen your computer monitor(s), laptop
screens, etc while making a video / movie so that you can
add the computer graphics to the screens later on (without
having to mess around deleting all the icons from your
desktops, changing the background colour of your desktop
to green, etc).

6. And FullScreenBackground would also be useful if
you have sensitive icons, information, etc on your
screen, and someone - a stranger or "busy body" -
walks by and they are trying to get a good look at what
you are doing, and you don't want them to mind their
own business.

FullScreenBackground is great in all of these cases.

I do lots of desktop How To videos and screen shots, so
I'm doing 1, 2, and 3 all the time (some times many times
a week, some weeks).


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Display a picture, image of your choice ... instead of just
  a single colour.

- Display a facsimilie of a spreadsheet, word document,
  or something else that has random data in it (so people
  don't get too curious about what is being hidden).

- Mouse lock, keyboard lock, password protect so that
  the screen provides some basic security if you walk
  away and leave your computer logged in / unlocked.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.
