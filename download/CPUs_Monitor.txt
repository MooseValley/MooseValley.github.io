Introduction :
--------------

CPUs Monitor is for IBM compatible PCs, desktops, laptops, 
netbooks, etc running any version of Windows from Windows 95 onwards, which 
includes Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, etc, 32 and 64 bit.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

CPUs Monitor:

- Displays CPU Utilisation (Usage) for each CPU in your system (unless 
  you turn this off in the Settings screen).
  
- Displays the average CPU Utilisation (Usage) according to settings 
  you specify on the Settings screen (Edit -> Settings).
  For example, you can specify that you want to see the Average CPU Usage 
  for all CPUs for each refresh (0 seconds), and/or the Average CPU Usage 
  for the last 5, 10, 30, 60, and/or whatever seconds you want, 
  and/or include the Average CPU Usage since the program has been 
  running (for this run of the program).

Lots of options are provided in the Settings screen (Edit -> Settings) 
to control the layout of the CPU graph.  And, as you change settings, 
the main screen's CPU graph automatically updates on-the-fly to reflect 
your latest settings.

CPUs Monitor also includes my "CPU Usage Drop alarm" functionality (similar to 
functionality included in my RAM / Swap Monitor and CPU Usage Drop Alarm programs).
When activated (by clicking the "Activate" button) this functionality 
plays a sound over and over again until the user clicks the OK button 
when the CPU usage drops below a user specified level for a user 
specified number of seconds.   This is very useful for telling you when a big 
job has ended, such as a Virus Scan, Disk Scan, Disk Defragment, CD/DVD Burning, 
video processing and conversions, etc.

I like to keep an eye on the resource usage (and the average resource usage) 
in my computer systems and I developed CPUs Monitor to help me do this.
Maybe someone else out there will find this useful as well ?

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, extract the contents of the CPU Usage Drop Alarm ZIP file to a directory,
such as c:\CPU_Usage_Drop_Alarm\ and then run the program by double clicking on the 
CPU_Usage_Drop_Alarm.EXE.  Then, watch the CPU usage graph change and/or change the 
program's settings (Edit -> Settings) to suit your needs.

On the Settings screen you can change:

* the CPU Refresh Delay / Timer Interval (milliseconds)

* Whether to Display CPU Usage for each CPU (checkbox)

* The Averages you want to display for prior seconds - just add values to the 
  list.  e.g. add 5 to the list to add the average CPU usage for the last 5 seconds 
  to the graph.

* Whether to Display Average CPU usage since program started (checkbox).

* Whether to Show Percentage Numbers in CPU Bar Graphs (checkbox).

* Chart Bar Colours: single, Multi (auto), or adjust the colours depending on each
  bar's length in the graph.  You can specify the threshold values and colours.
  For example, you can colour code the graph bars according to CPU utilisation.
  e.g. Green for 0-85, yellow for 85-95, and red for 96-100.

* The Chart Bar Style: rectangle, pyramid, etc.

* At the bottom of the settings screen is the MAX and Random CPU values 
  (these are for testing / demo purposes) which artifically sets the 
  CPU usage to 100 or a random value respectively for each CPU.  I used 
  for testing the averages, etc during this program's development.
  I have left it visible / enabled because it is interesting to watch the graphs, 
  averages, etc change.

A menu at the top of the main screen (where the CPU graph is) provides access to
various functionality.  e.g. you can enter the setting screen (Edit -> Setitngs).
A popup menu appears when you to right mouse click on the CPU graph to provide 
the same Edit menu functionality.

If you want this program to be "Always On Top" of other Windows, 
then select the "Always On Top" menu option under the "File" menu.


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Store Average CPU usage details for use next time the 
  program is run.

- More graph options ...  tons of options I could add here.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.


Special Thanks :
----------------

None so far.


Reviews / Awards / CDs :
-------------------------
