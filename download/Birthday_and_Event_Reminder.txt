Introduction :
--------------

Birthday and Event Reminder is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

Birthday and Event Reminder allows you to easily keep track of birthdays, 
anniversaries, school reunions, and other important annual events.

A range of functionality is provided with the program to help you add, 
update, change, or delete events, and then report on the events occuring 
within a specified number of days.  You can copy and paste this report 
into emails or print it.

This program should be very useful for helping you keep forwarned of all 
important dates, so that you give yourself plenty of time to organise and 
prepare for birthdays, anniversaries, and so on.

Now, there is NO EXCUSE for forgetting or leaving things until the last 
minute !!!  ;)

Import functionality is also provided so that you can load data from other 
date / event reminder programs directly into Birthday and Event Reminder 
without having to re-type anything. Importing data from the following 
programs is currently supported :
- Birthday Reminder v1.5a

N.B.  I am very willing to add import support for any other birthday / 
event / reminder programs you might be using.  Just send me your data 
files (or a sample of a data file), and I will add in the required support.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

Birthday and Event Reminder is for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, or 
later.  This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Credits / Thanks :
------------------

- Special thanks to Egil L for requesting that I develop this program.
  Egil has received a FREE registration because he suggested a program 
  that I believe is useful / desirable and I have gone ahead and 
  developed it.  If this program sells really well, then I'll also 
  be sending Egil a cheque (or "check" as American's say) depending 
  on how sales go.


Why I Wrote this Program :
--------------------------

Egil had been using "Birthday Reminder v1.5a" for many years.

Birthday Reminder v1.5a is an old Windows 3.x program from the mid-1990's 
from Chameleon Software (an Australian developer).

Egil had attempted to contact the developer and register the program, 
but the emails bounced, and he could not find any recent software 
of web pages for Chameleon, and it appeared that they hadn't updated 
any of their software or been in business for over 10 years.

So, Egil contacted me and asked me to develop my own version of 
"Birthday Reminder", which I have done.


Installing and Using this Program :
-----------------------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\Birthday_and_Date_Reminder\ - and run the 
executable file : Birthday_and_Date_Reminder.EXE.

If you want the program to run automatically when Windows
starts up, then select this option under the "File" menu 
in the program.

If you would like to be able to run this program by clicking 
on an icon in the Windows Start Menu, or on the Desktop, etc 
then you can use the "Create Shortcut ..." options under 
the program's File menu.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To add a new birthday, anniversary, etc, click the "Add" button, and 
select the event date, and fill in the name and event type fields.
The event type contains a list of pre-define event types - such as 
Birthday, Anniversary, etc, but you can type in your own even type 
here.  i.e. the event type list is just a basic suggestion list, 
you can type in your own event names or any other event types.  
e.g. "Tax Return Due" or "Baby Christening" or whatever you like.

To edit / modify an existing event, select it in the list and click the 
"Edit" button.  Change any data you want, and then click "OK" to accept 
the changed data or "Cancel" t reject any changes.

To delete an event, click on the event with the mouse and click the 
"Delete" button.  To delete multiple events, click on the first event
and with the left-mouse button held down, drag and highlight other events,
and then clicj with the mouse and click the "Delete" button.

To erase all events from the list, click the "Reset" button.

To ensure that you can never lose any data (even in a power failure), 
after every Add, Edit, or Import operation, the data is automaticaly 
saved to a file.

When you exit the program, the data is also automaticaly saved to a file.

When you Reset or Delete data, then the data is NOT automaticaly saved to 
file, and you can undo any deletions up to the last save point.  
i.e. up until the last Add, Edit, or Import operation, or up until the 
last time you exited the program - whichever is most recent.

To sort the data, click on any of the "Sort Data By" or "Sort Order" 
radiobuttons.

To get a list of all up and coming events click the "Report" button.  
A report of all coming events will be displayed, and you can copy 
this report to windows clipboard - so you can paste it into an email 
or other document - or you can print this report directly to a selected 
printer.

You can change the timeframe (i.e. the number of days before the event)
that you are warned, and also choose whether to display the report
automatically when the program is run, and whether to run the program 
automatically at Windows start-up.

The program should hopefully be pretty easy and straight forward to use.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete this program 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever 
    you installed it on your harddrive.

Before doing this however :

- If you have selected / enabled the "Auto-Run at Windows 
  Startup" option (under the File menu), then you should 
  ensure that this option is not checked / enabled 
  (which you can easily do by re-selecting the 
  "Auto-Run at Windows Startup" option from under 
  the File menu).

- If you have used any of the "Create Shortcut ..." options 
  under the File menu, then you should use the "Delete All 
  Shortcuts" option under the File menu to remove these from
  your system.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Birthday and event shopping lists, so you can enter shopping / 
  gift ideas for each event - which you can add as you think of 
  them during the year.  These could be printed in the report.

- One thing then program does not do is weed out any duplicates – 
  so if you Import the same data 5 times, then you will have 5 
  copies of it in the list, and the reminder for someone’s birthday 
  would appear 5 times on the report.

  I wasn’t sure whether to weed out duplicates or not.  e.g. there 
  could be 2 or more John Smiths with the same birthday – unlikely 
  but possible.

  If anyone feels strongly about this, then please let me know
  and I will add an optional setting into the program to enable you to 
  ignore duplicate data ifn you like.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, etc.
