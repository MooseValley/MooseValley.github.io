Subject: Fortinet web site scanner - FAULTY !

Hi Fortinet,

I have just scanned my web site using the VirusTotal URL scanner (http://www.virustotal.com/) which, at this current time, scans a given web site against 61 malware scanners.

All of these scanners very rightly give my web site (http://moosevalley.fhost.com.au/) a clean bill of health.  All that is, except for Fortinet which lists my web site as a "Malware site".

What the ????  I am very angry about this.  How dare you list my web site as a "Malware site".    My web site is NOT a malware site.  How DARE you suggest such a thing.  How DARE you peddle this nonsense to others.  What kind of show are you running ???

Mooses Software Valley (http://moosevalley.fhost.com.au/) is my web site. I love developing software. My web site is the platform for me to distribute my software. I have been running my web site and distributing my software since July-1996. According to the download logs for the last couple of years, my software has been downloaded and used by well over 200,000 people in just the last few years, and that excludes the downloads for the 1st 15 years of my web site and the dozens (100's) of mirrors for my software around the internet.

I am super paranoid about security and all of my PCs are subject to the highest levels of security, so you can rest assured that there are no viruses or malware in any of the software I provide on my web site, as confirmed by every single VirusTotal analysis of my software titles. :)

Once again, I do NOT do malware.  My web site is NOT a malware site.

Kindly fix your scanning algorithm, black list, and whatever else so that all of your future scans for my web site are 100% clean.
I will be scanning my web site with VirusTotal again in the future, and if this is still an issue - if Fortinet still claiming that my web site is a "Malware site" - then I will be contacting you again.
All the best,

 Mike "Moose" OMalley
