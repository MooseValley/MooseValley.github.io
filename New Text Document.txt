	Whoops, just realised that I released the updates onto my web site 1 week early.  Today is the Sat, 25-Jul-2021, and I released the 2 updates below
	on Fri, 23-Jul-2021 ... but had my wires crossed and through it was Thu, 29-Jul-2021.

	Obviously been working way too hard lately and not getting enough sleep.
	I was also determined not to miss the date, like I did with Sag Calculator v1.0's 20th Anniversary, and this somehow had me fix last Friday on my mind.

	Anyway, will keep the updates in place - so they will be "out of date order" with this update and 1 week early, but that's OK.
