Does PHP work on GitHub pages?

No, you cannot do that on Github Pages as it only supports static websites, i.e. sites built on html, css, JS. The good thing is that you can place your php in other server then use github repo html, javascript and call the php via ajax to load content result so you can have a dynamic page in github.
