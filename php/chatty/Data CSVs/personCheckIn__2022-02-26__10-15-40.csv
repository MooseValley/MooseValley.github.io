388,Mike,"2022-02-25 23:57:50","<h3>Bobcat Hire Issues:</h3> <br>* Drive to Murray's beach house, unhook trailer from Rav 4.  Park my hatchback up against trailer to stop anyone pinching it. <br>* Drive to Mum's to give her half of a lovely left-over Passionfruit Cheese Cake.  (I purchased 2 cheescakes yesterday for a treate for the office, Josh is going away for 2 months, etc). <br>* Fill the Rav 4 with fuel. <br>* Buy a new set of 3M ear muffs for use on the Bobcat. <br>* Got 60 L (3 x 20 L jerry cans) of Diesel at the farm for the Bobcat. <br> . So EVERYTHING is now ready to go ...  Excited and also terrified to be hiring a Bobcat (if anything goes wrong, I'm on my own).  Arrive at the Hire company right on 3:00 PM ... and hit a wall of issues: <br> . <br>* The bobcat was not available - it has wiring / wires catching fire issues ... <br>* The hire company could not call me because (as it turned out) there was a 1 digit error in my mobile phone number (the number Murray read out to me that I added to my phone and double checked with him a few weeks ago !!!!) <br>* They are getting another bobcat from Rocky, they left to pick it up at 2 PM, and it isn't back yet and probably wont be available tonight.  Has to be serviced / checked over.  Most likely, it will be available in the morning (Saturday) ... <br>* Thunderstorms are forecast tomorrow ... if it rains heavily over the weekend, then I wont get much done, because the lower ground - that I have to grade - gets really boggy, really fast.  Don't want to get the bobcat bogged - will cost me $$$ if I don't get it back by Monday 9 AM, and there's no way I can get it out (un-bog it) on my own, etc, etc. <br>* Hire company says I might as well go home.  Very unlikely Bobcat ready tonight, and if it is, the guy will deliver it to me (he lives nearby). <br>* So I drive home, and just get back to farm, grab a cold water, and Hire company rings - the Bobcat is here, will be ready for you to pick-up in 10 mins ... <br>* Rush back to town, see a near brand new Bobcat on a near brand new trailer - WOW. <br>* <br>* Attempt to pay the weekend Bobcat hire on my primary credit card and it would not work (Declined - Transaction not allowed on card.  What the ???) <br>* Try my backup EFTPOS card - none of my PIN numbers work (tried all the ones I use). <br>* Phone Murray - get the PIN for the motel credit card, just in case - it wont work. <br>* If I was here in my hatchback, I have cash hidden in the car - more than enough to cover the weekend Bobcat hire.  But I'm in the RAV, there's no such backup. <br>* Talk to guy, he agrees to credit card payment over phone, phone Murray and he pays. <br>* Backup Rav 4 up to Boobcat trailer and hook it on (with a forklift to help lift the front of the trailer to get the Jockey wheel down).  All is great !! <br>* Wait a sec ...  Hire guy thinks trailer is too low on back of Rav, is worried trailer will scrape on road / gutter as I exit, etc.  He shows me wires, etc the neck of the trailer and says if any of this is damaged it will be VERY expensive to fix - way more than the cost of hiring the Bobcat.  He gets second opinion from another Hire guy - he agrees.  They say ""If I want to risk it, I can go ..."".  No, no way.  If these 2 guys are worried, then I'm not going to risk it. <br>* Unhook Bobcat trailer from Rav 4 ... <br>* Hire delayed for 3 weekends - until Mum's eyes are OK again. <br>* Will need Murray's BIG 4WD in 3 weekends time. <br>* Drive back home to farm ... <br> . <br> Oh boy, what an afternoon ...."
387,Mike,"2022-02-25 22:47:38","Mum's Optus: The Optus mobile internet is slower than the motel internet (so is my mobile Telstra internet).  But this isn't the issue you are having.  The issue you are having is that you keep opening and closing stuff on your laptop and not giving it time to catch-up.  When you start up your laptop, give it a minute to finalise updates, cirus scan, check for updates, etc - make a cup of coffee while it does this.  With regard to battery devices, best to turn OFF the device and turn OFF charging at the power point over night."

371,Mike,"2022-02-19 21:17:42","Very hot day here.  Walk old driveway and take photos of the horrible state.  This old driveway was regularly graded, but was washed out during the Cyclone and has gone down hill a long way since then.  The central driveway has never been graded and only has a few bad spots near the Big Dam - so the central driveway is definitely the way to go.  Wait at front gate entrance for about 2 hours for tractor to arrive.  Speak to Mum, Murray, Francis on the phone.  Cut back weed.  Pull a bunch of logs / dead trees across old driveway to stop people trying to drive up it.  <h3>Leyland Tractor Arrives on Tilt Tray Truck:</h3> Tractor finally arrived around 11:30 AM.  Drive up very slowly powerline easement pushing dead trees over and attacking Lantana bushes in my way.  Then drive along the center section of my driveway, clearning vegetation along the sides.  Attempt to scratch up enough dirt / gravel to put into put holes near the Big Dam, but the ground is too hard - like concrete.  This big tractor with its heavy blade with metal ""stick rake"" teeth biting into the ground cannot penetrate much at all.  Hmmm ...  Still might need a bobcat - or a dozer - to try and dig up and move gravel from the sides of the track."

Drive to Bororen - about an hour south of Gladstone - to look at, test drive, and probably buy a big tractor with a heavy blade on the front.  Was asking $7,500.

Work on charity work while there. <h3>Exploring in Toyota 4WD:</h3> Return to farm and start my Toyota 4WD and go for a slow drive (low range) around as much of my land as possible - pushing through thick lantana, sapplings, and scrub, and find a way to drive along the powerline easement to the normal front entrance way - very rough - needs clearing and grading, but this will open up another way to enter / exit the property.  Push along the part of the north boundary and back down towards the centre - and was pushing a branch up the wind screen when my wind screen shattered.  Was going slow, and it wasn't a huge branch.  Just goes to show how easily even toughened wind screen glass breaks.  If I am going to be doing similar work with the $30K New Holland tractor, then its cab windows will all be broken in no time.  I really need an ugly tractor which is good mechanically. <h3>Keith B the neighbour:</h3> Meet the neighbour - Keith B - who turned out to be a great guy.  We got into his side-by-side ATV and he took me on a tour of his land, he has trails going everywhere, but has 2 bobcats to help him maintain them.  Awesome million dollar views from the high spots.  He also took me on a tour of his house - very beautiful and rennovated and doubled in size by Keith over the years.  He recommends I buy or hire a bobcat to do the clearing / fire breaks / open up trails, because they have a very low centre of gravity.  He reminded me that tractors have a very nasty habbit of tipping over even on groung that is not real steep (due to their high center of gravity)."

However, it is a really nice tractor, and I need it to do some really rough work through trees and branches - it will be a shame to damage the tractor, break windows in the cab, etc - but this sort of thing will be unavoidable to do the clearing, fire breaks, driveway work that I need to do.

But, it's all I have at this stage ... <br> Yesterday, the drive belt broke, or came off the pully's, when I was part way down the western fence line.  Today I took 2 big car ramps, tools, and rope out to mower and after trying numerous things, managed to get the rear of the mower onto the ramps by towing it onto the ramps with my hatch back car.  Spend about 30 minutes wrestling with the belt, pullys, and tough springs, but eventually manage to reset the drive belt (it had just come off the pully's due to vegetation and sticks being rammed up into the area). <br> Continue mowing ...  but about 20 mins later it happened again.  Return to the house and pick up my car, ramps, etc and reverse down the western fence line to the mower.  Had to reverse, because there is nowhere for a small car to turn around.  Go the belt back on, drive car back home, and continue mowing along western fence line.  Started heading for home near dusk, just as a huge rain storm hit.  I didn't mind getting soaked, it washed away the dirt and the grass that covered me. <br> Shower, wash my hair, dinner.  So tired ..."

Of course they do.  SOLD.  End of story.  Shane (the seller) is a really nice guy, a boiler maker with a huge shed of tools and projects at Port Alma ...  he had purchased both tractors for $2,500 and had put a a fair amount of work into them - welding the front mini grader blade onto the front of the yellow 2WD tractor and a terrific home made crane on the back of the blue  4WD tractor.

Yep, I want them, let`s go.  Murray replied to the Ad - the first reply, got the sellers phone and address, and we were first cab off the rank (or so we thought).  I threw a 20 Liter of Diesel, a spare battery, and tools into the car and took off for Rocky, picked Murray up, and headed for Port Alma - on the southern outskirts of Rocky.  We got there about 10 mins too late - an old guy beat us to it. <br> I hung round, chatted, drooled over both tractors, and waited for the old guy to make a decision.  He hummed and haahed for about 30 mins, he is looking for a tractor for his son, who has a very steep block near Mt Morgan, he thought he only wanted the blue 4WD tractor (the 2WD Yellow tractor would not handle the steep terrain), but would need to check with his son.  I wanted the 2WD yellow tractor - with the really heavy small mini blade on the front, to smooth out my driveway, trails, and push the vegetation back.  <br> I offered the old guy $2,500 for the Yellow tractor - so he would get the blue 4WD tractor for free.  And he hummed and haahed and eventually ""nooo, I need to wait for my son to see which one he wants"".  I hung around, chatted, and tried to get the old guy to make a decision and say ""YES"" for the yellow tractor, and all he could do was hum and hah and ""no, I`ll wait for my son"".  But, eventually, it was clearly no-use, and Murray and I left.  <br> Anyway, after lots of phone calls, and strong hints at higher than $2,500 offers, and an eternity of waiting, I finally got confirmation from Shane (the original seller) the next day (on Saturday at about 11:30 AM), that the old guy and his son want both tractors. <br> <b>Absolutely gutted ...</b> <br> <b>Lesson for the future:</b> - if a great / amazing deal is listed on Marketplace (or anywhere else), then buy it sight unseen.  Being first cab off the rank in replies means NOTHING.  The first to say ""I`ll take it, I`ll pay your price"" - by phone, by message, or in person - get`s the item(s). <br> On Friday afternoon, while waiting on the edge of my seat for the old guy to make a decision, I went shopping - picked up a poly connector I needed for toilet cistern, and purchased a heavy duty car / truck battery charger.  Can`t stop hoping for the yellow tractor ..."

Also throw assorted ribbish that I can fit onto the trailer - that Murray was stacked up to the house fence.  And (after double checking with Murray) put the double bed and base from the garage on the top.  Jeremy (ne owner) helped me load the trailer.  Take the lot to the dump.

301,Mike,"2022-01-24 13:04:05","<h3>Motel Post-Settlement</h3>  <p> Spoken to new owners several times since Settlement and they are very happy !  When Murray or I visit the house (Murray is still cleaning-up / moving out), they always come over and say a friendly hello and want to take us and show us what they are doing. </p>  <p> They are making lots of improvements - repainting, new ceiling fans, new modern down lights, a louver  partition between apartments, extending the paved area around the pool (fenced), and I think adding in a sunken fire / BBQ / entertaining area and a fancy Balinese style Gazebo, and who knows what else ?? </p>  <p> I sure hope people (customers) appreciate the new motel facilities ...  so many of our customers arrived after driving for ~6-8 hours and they are tired and grumpy and just want to get into an air conditioned apartment and close the door.  Some families often arrived for a 4+ night holiday, and they go into the apartment, put the air conditioner on maximum cold, and close the door and you only see them when they emerge to get some dinner in the evening - and that's it - they never go to the beach, never swim in the pool, never go up to Byfield or the Croc Farm or The Caves. </p>  <p> I would have loved to put in sunken fire / BBQ / entertaining area but was always trying to guess how many people would use it, and not abuse it or disturb other guests late at night - like getting drunk and rowdy, burning plastic bottles, etc - and the voice in my head always said ""nope, not a good idea"".   </p>  <p> Even if most apartments join in on the fun and have a party around the fire pit on a Friday or Saturday night, the 1 or 2 apartment that do not join in will leave such horrible / scathing reviews because of late night noise, that you will wish you had never put the fire pit in. </p>  <p> Before Settlement, I gave the new owners a mini course on running a motel, taking bookings, turning on and off apartments on Booking.com and setting prices, highlighted a bunch of things they can do if they want more bookings, and things to watch out for (scams, issues, etc).  And I gave them a USB drive with useful documents and templates: future bookings, booking spreadsheet, vacancy chart, guest rego form template, guest enquiry template, etc and the usernames and passwords for all Motel accounts.  And I also drove up to Rocky OfficeWorks to print an A3 sized Vacancy Chart (multiple pages) so they can see at a glance what their bookings are for the next 12 months. </p>  <p> <br>Their daughter is doing the office / reception work, web page, emails, social media. <br>Their book keeper (from their painting business) is doing the book work. <br>They are sending the laundry out to a commercial laundry for washing. <br>Jeremy is continuing to do his house painting business ... </p>  <p> <br>They have my mobile number and email if they have any questions. <br><b>I hope they do very well and make a packet.</b> </p>"

Almost .... </h3> A <b>2005 McCormick GX50 tractor</b> has come up For Sale (listed on Facebook Marketplace last night, Saturday night) with full cab, front end loader, fork lift forks, and slasher for $13,500 all in great condition and available locally, just down the road from me.  Investigate McCormick tractors - do some research on-line to make sure they aren't a crappy import tractor, like the many Chinese and Indian scam tractors now flooding the market, which are really low quality, have crappy aluminium engines, and don't even last 50-100 hours of light use.  McCormick seem like a decent brand.  From about 9 AM on, Murray messaged the guy, and continued through-out the day, trying to get an inspection and/or a mobile number from him, and in the late afternoon the seller finally reported back that the tractor had SOLD.  Things really sell fast on Facebook Marketplace.   <br> You can see pics of this type of tractor here (look for a full cab with front end loader): https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=McCormick+GX50+tractor&iax=images&ia=images <br><b>Oh well, maybe next time ...  👍</b>"
296,Mike,"2022-01-23 19:33:35","Farm: you might be wondering why I had to run new water pipe to the toilet.  Well, until now, the outside toilet and inside toilet had been gravity fed water from the tank half way up the hill, which contains dam water - water which is pumped up from the dam, about 300 m away, and the water is the colour of tea - quite dark.  This dam water tank was great to conserve rain water tank water, but is not all that nice to look at in a toilet.  The tank half way up the hill is now empty - and that explains why the inside toilet stopped filling after 1 fill when I loved in.  As well as the ""dam"" tank half way up the hill, I also have 4 full rain water tanks here, which are full of rain water - but this raim water has been sitting for at least 5+ years, and likely more than 15 years in spme of the tanks.  So I really need to use this water and flush the tanks out and then pray for more rain to fll them up again.  So, running the toilet from rain water tank water is fine."

He had to organise a Pay Loader (huge, articululated front end loader) to come and pull the truck out.

274,Mike,"2022-01-10 22:45:08","This morning: Meet with Real Estate Agent (Debbie) and new Buyers (Jeremy).  They were worrying about ""how to run a motel, how to take bookings, manage vacancies, etc"".  So today we were supposed to run through all of this so they are ready to GO at Settlement Date, on Fri, 14-Jan-2022 (this Friday).  However, Lousie - the one who will be runnibg the motel - did not turn up.  What the ???  Showed Jeremy the switchboards, building lights controls, walked him through the pool and filter operation, showed him the cleaned out garden Shed #1, showed him the Maytag washing machines (he wants 2).    Their finance is all approved bu BoQ, but BoQ want a 2nd mortgage on the Buyer's rental house, and Westpac are dragging their heels over the paper work.  This could delay settlement by up to 2 weeks.  Am exmploring options where they can move in and start doing the rennovations they want in Manager's Apartment while living in Unit 11 and using Unit 2 as a store room for 2 weeks, and then have the formal settlement on Fri, 28-Jan-2022 - where they get the keys for and access to the rest of the motel.  They will only be able to accept bookings that arrive on or after Fri, 28-Jan-2022.  The phone and power will stay in my name, to avoid issues is settlement fails later (how do I get the power and phone back in my name, if they refuse to relinquish, etc).  They have only recently - last week - got their insurance in place.  No interconnected smoke alarms are needed (as per the legislation and my earlier posts).  They should have got their insurance organised the secodn they signed the contract - 3 months ago - now a week ago.  This kind of stuff should not be happening now at the 11th hour.  The insurance, the finance, etc should have all been sorted out weeks (or more) ago."

267,Mike,"2022-01-07 12:12:09","Another example of the types of emails / questions I am dealing with on a daily basis (short questions, requiring long, complex, accurate answers):  <br><h3>Debbie (Agent) said:</h3> Hi Mike, <br>  Do you mind if I ask a few questions the insurance provider wants. <br>  Is there fire protection in the rooms. <br> When was the wiring last checked by a technician. <br> Is fire protection checked every 6 months? <br> Is there any eps in the building (Expanded polystyrene). <br> The rating of the motel. <br>  Thanks Mike.  <br><h3>My Reply:</h3> <br> All great questions Debbie. <br>   <b>*** Is there fire protection in the rooms.</b> <br>  The motel has the following fire warning / prevention: <br> * Battery smoke alarms are in all apartments (and spares and brand new batteries in the reception). <br> * The rock block walls between all apartments are (as far as I can tell) concrete filled to prevent fire spreading from one apartment to another. <br>  When the motel was insured by AON / CGU and later on Elders, I asked both insurance companies about fire protection (they knew the motel buildings / construction well) and asked if anything was needed - fire hoses, sprinkler systems, fire blankets, fire extinguishers or anything else ? - and they both said No.  I asked ""will my premiums be cheaper if I install fire hoses, sprinkler systems, fire blankets, fire extinguishers, etc in all apartments"" - and both said No.  I was pretty amazed at their answers !  I was hoping to spend money and reduce insurance premiums. <br>  When the new smoke alarm legislation came in recently (all rental houses must have smoke alarms that are wired + battery powered), I asked 2 of the companies who quoted on installing the upgraded smoke alarms in my Clayton Rd rental property - ""do motels / motel apartments need to comply with this new smoke alarm requirement.  And both said they would check the legislation and with their government contacts and phone and email back if wired + battery powered smoke alarms are required in motels / motel apartments.  Neither phoned or emailed back.  So I assume the answer is ""Not required"". <br>   <b>*** When was the wiring last checked by a technician.</b> <br>  Do you mean <b>""motel wiring""</b> ?  In 2007, we had Safety Switches installed in the elctrical switchboard in every motel apartment (and manager's apartment / office).  Prior to then, the only Safety Switch was installed in the main switch board for the motel.  The electrician went over everything with a fine tooth comb while doing this work.  From memory, it was Michael Findlay who did this work. <br>  If you mean <b>""appliance wiring""</b> (for toasters, kettles, hotplates, etc) the answer is NEVER.  We simply replace the appliances periodically with brand new appliances.  This is much cheaper overall than paying $35 per appliance for someone to ""inspect"" it.  What a scam that is ! <br>   <b>*** Is fire protection checked every 6 months?</b> <br>  Murray and I check the smoke alarms in each apartment and change the batteries every 12 months.  Customers often break and disable smoke alarms on purpose.  e.g. if the smoke alarm goes off because they burned the toast while making breakfast, they often just smash the alarm.  People also regularly steal batteries from remote controls and also smoke alarms.  We often find strange batteries in these devices, not the brand(s) we use.  You have to be constantly vigilante when running a motel.  Customers do a lot of stupid and crazy stuff.  e.g. If the TV remote suddenly stops working, then check the batteries, and if the batteries looks strange check DVD player remote, air-cond remote and smoke alarm battery to make sure they are all the ones we supplied. <br>   <b>*** Is there any eps in the building (Expanded polystyrene).</b> <br>  None that I know of ...  Never heard of it.  Is this a fire suppression system ?  Anyway, nothing like that here to the best of my knowledge. <br>   <b>*** The rating of the motel.</b> <br>  Do you mean <b>Fire Rating</b> ?  Unknown.  Council should have this information from when the motel plans were submitted in 1981/82 approx. <br>  If you mean <b>Accommodation Rating</b> - like the star rating - then we have not had a rating for a long time.  We used to be RACQ rated 3.5 star.  The RACQ man who did the yearly inspections said we were ""extremely close to 4 star"" and if we (1). put some stools / chairs in the office, so customers could sit down while they check-in and (2). placed little bottles of shampoo and conditioner in each apartment, then we would qualify for a <b>4 star rating</b>.  I have stayed in 3 star and 3.5 star accommodation run by managers on the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast, and none of the apartments were as nice as what we provide.  An owner run motel wil almost always be cleaner and better maintained and better customer service than a leased or manager run motel - because they don't have the same level of vested interest in ensuring everything is as good as it can be.  For the owner run motel, everything is on-the-line and important.  Anyway, these star ratings cost about $600 pa (if I remember correctly).  And I just did not think they were worth the money and stopped bothering about 10 years ago (from memory).  The whole star rating thing seems like a bit of a scam."
266,Mike,"2022-01-07 11:50:05","Another example of the types of issues I am dealing with on a daily basis:  <br><h3>Debbie (Agent) said:</h3> * ""We are going to have issues with the smoke alarms at the motel as the legislation states that they have to be interconnected.  Would you like me to organise someone to do this for you? This has been in force for some time."" <br><h3>My Reply:</h3> <br> First I`ve heard of this requirement Debbie.  AON / CGU had not heard of this in approx 2014 when I was still insured with them.  And Elders Insurance also had never heard of this when I was insured with them in 2015 and 2016 (or around then). <br> Also, as I said in my email to you on Wed, 5 Jan 2022, 08:04:59 pm: * When the new smoke alarm legislation came in recently (all rental houses must have smoke alarms that are wired + battery powered), I asked 2 of the companies who quoted on installing the upgraded smoke alarms in my Clayton Rd rental property - ""do motels / motel apartments need to comply with this new smoke alarm requirement.  And both said they would check the legislation and with their government contacts and phone and email back if wired + battery powered smoke alarms are required in motels / motel apartments.  Neither phoned or emailed back.  So I assume the answer is ""Not required"". <br>  I have just re-checked the definitive guide - the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) Queensland government web site, and it very clearly says: <br>  * ""From 1 January 2022, landlords must install interconnected smoke alarms in residential rental properties. ...   All other dwellings must transition to full compliance by 2027.""  Ref: https://www.qfes.qld.gov.au/prepare/fire/smoke-alarms <br>  And: <br>  * ""From 1 January 2022: All homes or units being sold or leased, or existing leases renewed, will require hardwired photoelectric, interconnected smoke alarms. Non-removable 10-year battery smoke alarms can be installed in place. ...  The property seller must declare on a “form 24” to the buyer as part of the transfer process that this obligation has been discharged."", Ref: https://www.qfes.qld.gov.au/prepare/fire/smoke-alarms/properties-for-sale-or-lease <br>  It specifically says residential Rental Properties like houses and units.  Form 24 is all to do with Bond Lodgement for Residential properties and does NOT apply to commercial properties like motels, hotels, etc.  When we collect BONDs from guests - which we do frequently - then we keep these, we do NOT pass them onto the Residential Tenancies Authority because our motel business has NOTHING to do with Residential Tenancies.  We are classes as a commercial business providing short term accommodation.  It does NOT say anything directly about commercial properties like motels, hotels, etc.  But it does say ""All other dwellings must transition to full compliance by 2027"".  So if we are classed as a ""dwelling"" , then it isn`t a requirement for now, it is a requirement for 2027 - 5 years from now. <br>  To check this further, I have just phoned the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES), and they confirmed that none of this applies to commercial properties like motels, hotels, etc.  We provide Short Term Accommodation, and this comes under the National Construction Code (NCC) - a whole different kettle of fish, and our existing smoke alarms are perfectly fine, according to them.  (If our smoke alarms were interconnected, then the whole motel would have to be evacuated when someone burnt some toast as the QFES lady said on the phone, "" this would be an absolutely rediculous situation""). <br>  Also, the Buyer`s Solicitor confirmed that the motel passed Building and Pest inspections on 7-Dec-2021 - see emails below.  Issues like this should have been identified and brought up then, not at the 11th hour just prior to Settlement.  I have never heard to Buyers bringing up issues or requiring action / work after notifying the Building and Pest Inspections have passed. <br>  Is this why the Buyer`s Solicitors are ignoring all my my emails asking if the contract is now Unconditional ?  What else are they going to spring on me at this late hour ?  Is this the final hurdle ? <br>  Debbie: are you 100% sure interconnected smoke alarms are required at commercial properties like motels NOW ?  Please provide a reference that proves this and overrules the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) and their Queensland government web site. <br>  If you can prove this is required for a motel, do you know of anyone that can do the ""interconnected smoke alarms"" work - a top quality job done within the next week or so ?"

Only neighbour knows how to start the tractor, so I have to wait for him to show me.  Strange but true.  Load most of Murray's plants / garden beds into trailer so he can take them to Rocky tomorrow.  Still getting lots of emails / questions from Buyers - things they should have asked months ago and also things they should have had answered by their Building Report.  Still no official confirmation from Buyer's Solicitor about UNCONDITIONAL status.  Agent, Buyers, etc have confirmed - just not their Solicitor.  Very strange.

The brand new shed I had out there was destroyed in a storm about 5-6 weeks ago when I found the wreckage strewn across the yards and paddock. So, everything is sitting in a carport on some old roofing iron (to keep it out of any water that might flow through in a storm).<br>Get stuck into doing more changes of address, phone, email, etc. In the good old days you could do a mail merge in Word and send letters out to banks, etc, but they now want everything done using their on-line web portals / apps - so I have to login to each, find out how / where to change details, change details, and double check. Most web portals / apps are pretty easy, but some, like CQUni`s are very convoluted and strange. Some web portals / apps I don`t have access to, so I need to arrange access (logins). For others, I need to physically go into the bank branch and fill out forms (because internet banking is <b>not</b> turned on or available by default if you only have a term deposit). Fiddly work that soaks up hours. Oh yes, I also need Murray to be around for some of this (those sites that insist on sending SMS security codes and don`t support safer alternatives like Authy) so that I can update the SMS security code mobile phone from his phone to mine.  Swim in the pool on dark, with a few Bourbons and Coke. Nice end to a very hot day."

258,Mike,"2022-01-03 19:40:06","The motel has sold – suddenly unconditional.  Real Estate agent confirmed today.  Buyer’s solicitor expected to confirm tomorrow (public holiday today).  The Buyer’s house has sold, the person buying the Buyer’s house had to sell their house in NSW, which has now sold and is now unconditional as well.  The chain didn’t break.  Woo Hoo !!!  Settlement Date is Fri, 14-Jan-2022. <br> I’m going to need every day this week and next week to move, take care of things, etc. <br> The Buyer’s are hanging around the motel a lot now, wanting to chat: more than 1.5 hours yesterday, and more than 2.5 hours today.   This is slowing down the tasks I need to complete, and / or is pushing them into the hottest times of the day. The Buyer’s will soon be storing their stuff here – inside motel apartments.   <br> My plan was to take them on a tour the day before settlement – show them the light switches and the timers, our phone system, and also giving them a quick run through of running a motel, recording bookings, vacancy tables, etc.   <br> But they said today that they are hoping I can spare a few days (!!!!!) to teach them how to run a motel (take bookings, track bookings, setup web sites like Booking.com, use channel manager software, etc, etc).  They don’t even know what Excel and Word are,  and I now doubt they can do anything useful on a computer.  They had no idea what HTML was …  There’s no way these people can come up to speed on using computers quickly without some very intensive training …    <br> I’m going to suggest a very simple paper based system to start with – they can always use Excel or specialised motel management software later if they want.  They have a book keeper already doing their books for their existing business, so at least that’s something they wont have to worry about.   <br> We discovered today that the wife sends her home laundry out to be washed – she doesn’t wash it herself.  Her husband is a painter, so he has good links to Traddies – which will help them a lot.  But he said today that he has no idea how to fix anything around the house (or the motel or a car) …  Yiikes.  When you run a motel, you have to be able to fix / handle everything reasonable / possible, otherwise all of your profits are going to go to Traddies charging you everytime something simple needs fixing. <br> Painting, unblocking clogged drains and toilets, fixing burst water pipes, vacuuming and backwashing the pool, servicing / replacing the pool’s salt cell and the filter, fixing / replacing damaged or broken items, etc – they need to be prepared to do all of this stuff.  When you run a business the buck stops with you.  You cannot rely on getting a Traddie out to help on a Friday night, or Christmas Eve. <br> I sure want them to do well, but I’m worried they might be in over their heads, and I definitely don’t want to be their Free Help Desk or be getting multiple calls from them each week: “how to I record a payment”, “how do I give a discount”, “how do I do a booking”, “how do I …”, etc. <br> If I’d known how completely clueless they were 2+ months ago, I would have made some getting started / training videos for them.  But there’s definitely no time for this now, 12 days prior to Settlement."

(2). the 24 hour timer on the motel lights neeeds replacing. (3). the pool filter might need replacing (but the new Salt Cholinator has a timer that will power the filter as well).  (4). the air conditioner in the manager's apartment bedroom is iffy and is on the way out (nice and cold, but hard to turn ON sometimes).  (5). the air conditioner in the main area of the manager's apartment has not been used in 10 years, and does not work.

And, when Jean moves to Rocky, she will need someone to mind her if Murray wants to / feels like travelling to the coast to do any moving, packing, cleaning, etc in Unit 12 or the house.  Murray really needs to pick up the pace and take good note of the urgency.  I keep trying to get him to make a daily plan of what he is going to do between today and Settlement Date (or soon after) to ensure everything in Unit 12 and the house is moved, sold, put out For Free, or taken to the dump, and all required cleaning done, but he refuses, gets angry, and digs his heels in.  He always has a list of others to blame: he has no idea when Settlement Date is, his brothers are useless and never help him mind Jean, no-one ever helps him with Jean (what about me and Mum.  I mind Jean at least 20 hours per week), he is never going to fit everything in the Rocky house (very true - so he must sell, give away, or dispose of tons of stuff ASAP), and on and on it goes."

Prado keys back at motel, so cannot drive Prado down and drag Getz out.  Carried 2 planks and a brick down and shoed these under wheels, no good.  Mud too soft from weeks of almost daily heavy rain.  Prepared to sleep at house - no power, no water, no water for shower, toilet, etc.  But, just as I'm drifting off, Murray came and got me.  Murray and Jean went to Christmas Carols in Yeppoon in the evening (from about 6:30 PM until about 8:30 PM)."

204,Mike,"2021-12-10 23:18:33","Murray must sort his house out ASAP.  The last 3-4 weeks and the next 7-10 days are the prime time for Murray sorting out the house and moving.  Now is the time to clean-up, sort out, throw out, and move - while the weather is still relatively cool, and while the motel is empty (only Jean and 1 long stay worker are here).  Murray must get his act together and sort out the mountains of stuff in his house and throw out what he can, or pack and move what he can.  Now.  The motel has had NO Vacancy signs and Booking.com turned off for months.  We have accepted NO bookings at all for the last 3+ weeks, and nothing this week, but have 3 bookings for next weekend and then NO bookings until Christmas.  Murray cannot spend a year or so moving out of the house, like he did when he moved from Waters St down to here.  I want the house empty, clean, and on the market ASAP - strike while the property market is going well.  Moving out of the house after the motel sale has settled - and being watched by the peanut gallery in the motel would be horrible.  In late December and January, it's going to be a lot hotter, and much harder.  And when Jean is living in Rocky, how the hell is Murray going to get days to come down here and sort the house out.  His brothers / family wont help at all.  Mum and I have been minding / sitting with Jean to give Murray as much time as possible to get stuck in for months now.  He must get at least 95%+ of his stuff out of the house within the next 7-10 days."

He shook his head at the mess of cables going from the house to Unit 12 and the antenna cable mess outside Unit 12.  He asked me who did the work, I said ""a local guy, but I cannot say who"", he asked ""was it Herbie ?"", and I laughed.  Yes it was.  He said he has had to fix a lot of Herbie's work on the coast.  After doing testing the wall socket signal strength inside Units 5, 6, 11, 12 and the house, we disconnected Unit 12 from the house - no more cables spanning the gap.  He tested the signal strength on the roof of Unit 12 and mounted a new antenna on Unit 12's roof.  He checked out the splitter box at the back Unit 6 - old, needs replacing.  He recommends in the long term we run new cabling from the aerial to each unit along the back with as few joins as possible, we can probably use the existing cabling from the back of each unit to the wall socket inside ... but this can wait.  Each apartment gets a good enough signal for now.  He also replaced the slim gray box (about the size of a cigarette packet) on the house's TV antenna (the old box had fallen off and was upside down and full of water and badly corroded).  And he put a new connection and wall antenna socket inside the house (in the corner of the living room).  Also put a new booster in the house - the old one was damaged, was wrapped in electrical tape."

Went to Bunnings and they had the sheds in stock, but many boxes were labelled incorrectly or contradictingly.  e.g. the same box could be lalbelled ""Box 1 of 2"" and also ""Box 2 of 2"".  We called for help, and it took a staff member about 30 mins to turn up.  And his ""help"" was useless.  He admitted that many of the sheds in stock were ""returns"" and they had no idea what was actually in the boxes: ""Box 1 of 2"", ""Box 2 of 2"", complete, incomplete, something else ?  Murray purchased a single shed.  Everything was supposed to be pre-drilled, and it should simply have been a matter of screwing everything together.  Except very few of the holes matched up, even after spinning things around and swapping parts of trying all combinations.  So almost everything had to be drilled again - properly.  Luckily Murray's 2 bothers Neil and Barry turned up and helped.  It took all 4 of us the whole afternoon to put the shed up.  In the boiling hot sun, with very little shade.  Still got the doors to finish, and bolt the shed down to the concrete slab.  Maybe 2-3 hours of work left to do.  A long hot day.  Very tired."

Coowonga: spent most of today out at Coowonga, from before 8 AM until after 2 PM, waiting for Ergon Energy to show up to do an inspection / test on the house before turning the electricity back on.  I was very clear on the phone with Ergon that the driveway was very soggy / boggy in places, and that there was water over the dirt track in other places - up to a foot deep and about 60m or so long.  My small hatchback car can make it through, so the Ergon guys in their 4WD will EASILY make it through.  Ergon was happy with this and went ahead and booked today as the day power will be turned back on.  I had to wait out there from 8 AM until 5 PM, and wait for the Ergon guys to turn up.  I cannot leave.  They cannot give me a more exact time.  At about 2 PM, Murray came out to the farm.  Ergon had apparently been out earlier in the day, and had seen water over the track and had gone back out again.  Apparently the pussies aren't allowed to proceed if there is any water over the track.  Why the Face didn't they tell me this over the phone when I booked the appointment, instead of telling me everything was fine.  Ergon Energy have proven again that they provide horrible, terrible customer service.  Now I have to wait for the drive-way to dry out, and this could take weeks - especially if the heavy rain continues."

125,Mike,"2021-11-08 15:13:19","Thanks Francis.   I just watched some YouTube (ABC, Four Corners, etc) videos on Sydney and Melbourne house markets.  Your house even in its current state has got to be worth $900+K.  Sure wish you'd sell it and get that weight off your back.  People, traddies, etc are looking for projects they can do.  As I said in a prior post:  If something is pinning you down, wearing you down, weighing on you, now is the time to make a change for the better.   Do it !  You will feel so much better !  Just want you to be happy !  👍 💖 😀"
124,Mike,"2021-11-08 14:47:51","Motel Sale - Latest News - 2:30 PM, 8-Nov-2021:  Debbie has just phoned.  They are very keen.  Very happy with the price.  Etc.  They met with BoQ who balked at the figures - especially last financial year's figures, which were a long way down on the prior years.  I told Debbie that I do my banking with BoQ, know Dan Lorroway, BoQ manager, they gave me my $1.2 million line of credit 12 years ago (when I purchased Mum's half), which I paid off after about 5 years, etc.  So, BoQ know this business well, they know what it is capable of, and BoQ have a very short and faulty memory if they have any reservations about this property.  Debbie will let the buyers know this.  In any case, BoQ are happy to lend the people the money - providing they sell their house first.  Debbie has inspected their house and thinks they will have no problems getting $850+K.  (Big house, big shed, tons of room for a boat, pool, etc - all in beautiful condition).  So, we are now looking at the sequence:  selling their house, sorting finance, and then buying the motel.  At this stage, Debbie thinks they are going to sign a contract Subject to Finance with 40 days to sort out finance, with the aim of settling (taking over the motel) in mid-January.  This will mean that they miss the Christmas PEAK - about $15K - and will be coming to the motel at the quietest of times - Jan, Feb, Mar, April historically are the quietest months on average."

Jean is so happy to (hopefully) be ""back in her home for Christmas"".  Murray super happy.  Mum super happy.  The buyers are going to do really well here.  The motel is a bargain.  I wish them the very best.  Took another load out of packed boxes out to the old farm house.  Picked up the Rav (2 containers of fuel), which we left there last night (not enough fuel to get home).  Got a good feeling about tomorrow - Monday.  A REAL GOOD FEELING !!  👍 💖 😀"

Special thanks to Mum for sitting with / minding Murray's mother for us.  Also made a start on cleaning out Murray's house and getting him a clear space to start work in - he can now move forward.  The buyers increased their offer this evening.  Got a feeling Murray and I will be FREE before Christmas.  I think I will be buying a shipping container so Murray has somewhere to store his stuff.  Might get one for me as well.  😀"

110,Mike,"2021-11-05 21:54:55","Had our first inspection today …  and they put in an offer straight away.  A really good offer as well ...  Only verbal.  Nothing in writing yet.  (Hard to take an offer seriously until it is in writing).  They were really nice people.  And obviously really smart as well - they instantly recognised a great buy when they see one.  If all goes well, should be moving house soon ...  Will see what happens over this weekend and make a decision on Monday.  No need to rush ... I've paid for months of premium advertising, and no-one in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane has even hhad a chance to look yet, so I might as wait a few days ..."

108,Mike,"2021-11-05 15:21:09","Inspection went very well.  But I do find it very hard to be a SELLER ...   would infinitely rather be a BUYER.  I see something I like, I do my research, I get my finance sorted before make an offer, I know my budget, I BUY.   No messing around.  I don't need to pick holes and find flaws in what people are selling, and I don't want to screw them down in price.  Not that these people did any of this ...  but from past experiences SELLING, I dread what might be coming.  Tyre kickers, bargain vultures, clueless idiots, time wasters.  Anyway, trying to stay POSITIVE !.  👍"
