Subject: Re: Person Check-In App - now ChatterBox with new link

Now renamed to "ChatterBox" with a new link:
http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/chatty/index.php

Note: anyone can select their name from the list and type in a comment of how they are going.

It's nice to be able to see how people are going.

Kind of like Tiwtter, but just for us ...

Have a nice day.  :)

Subject: Fw: Person Check-In App

You can see how Mum is going ...
http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/personcheckin/index.php

Very basic.  Not secure.  No login.  Don't type any credit card details or addresses, etc into the app.

Note: we are in the 21st century.  Mum and I talked about how I can monitor her without causing hassle or disturbing her - in case she has a turn or a fall - phone call twice a day, emails twice a day, or a little App.  She liked the App idea best.

This app will work from mobile phone, tablet, PC, Mac, etc.

You guys and Mary, Henry, and Scott can also use this app if you want.

Have a nice day.  :)

Hi Chookie,

The app is ready for use.  Please Bookmark this page in your broswer - or I will do it for you when I next see you:

http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/personcheckin/index.php

You can leave the "All OK" comment or type in any comment you like .

Click the "Add" button whenever you feel like it - once in the morning, once in the afternoon or evening would be ideal, but whenever convenient for you.

A new screen will appear telling you everything was successful.  Click the "Home" button to return to the main screen.

You can scroll down and look at all of the messages - all just TEST messages from me so far.

I will monitor this page during the day and night to make sure you are all ok.

Have a nice day.  :)
