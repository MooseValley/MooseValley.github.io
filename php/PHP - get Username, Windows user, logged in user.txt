$user = $_SERVER['AUTH_USER'];


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/168610/can-you-get-a-windows-ad-username-in-php

I've got php mysql running on IIS - I can use $_SERVER["AUTH_USER"] if I turn on Windows Authentication in IIS -> Authentication and turn off Anonymous authentication (important)

I've used this to get my user and domain:

$user = $_SERVER['AUTH_USER'];

$user will return a value like: DOMAIN\username on our network, and then it's just a case of removing the DOMAIN\ from the string.

This has worked in IE, FF, Chrome, Safari (tested) so far.




After turning on Windows Authentication in IIS -> Authentication and turn off Anonymous authentication it worked for me. Thank you, Cheers! –

Look at the PHP LDAP library functions:
http://us.php.net/ldap.
Active Directory [mostly] conforms to the LDAP standard.
