ERROR:
session_start(): Cannot send session cookie - headers already sent by


You cannot have a blank line or even a comment above the session_start() code.

Had to change this:

<!-- index.php -->
<?php
@ob_start();
session_start();
//if(session_status()!=PHP_SESSION_ACTIVE) session_start();
?>
::::

TO (move the comment down):

<?php
@ob_start();
session_start();
//if(session_status()!=PHP_SESSION_ACTIVE) session_start();
?>
<!-- index.php -->

That's fucking insane !!!!!!

It is not intuitive but ...

if <?php is at line 2 of your script and a blank line is above it then that can cause problems such as the php header function not working.

I had a HEADER session_regenerate error because a script called by require_once () or include () had 1 blank line below the closing php tag !!

?>
BLANK LINE WAS HERE

echo statements will also be a problem if they precede the header function call.
I wonder if die() or any other statements which write to the screen would be just as bad as echo () in this situation.
