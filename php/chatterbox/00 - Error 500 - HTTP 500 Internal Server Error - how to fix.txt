This error bamboozled me for about an hour.

My Air Conditioner app was working fine - using PHP on the same server and hooked up to exactly the same database.
http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/aircond/index.php

But my Chatter App:

http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/personcheckin/index.php

would not work.  I reverted back to a known working backup and uploaded it, and it still would not work.

I ran the app locally in XAMPP and it worked perfectly.

None of the associated PHP files worked, for example:

http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/00__Extract_Data_to_CSV.php

had exactly the same error / issue - nothing happened / Error 500.

WTF ???


So, what I did was rename the folder on my local PC:

personcheckin

to:

chatterbox

and FTP uploaded this folder to my web site:

http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/

and ran it:

http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/chatterbox/index.php

and it worked perfectly.

Woo hoo !!
