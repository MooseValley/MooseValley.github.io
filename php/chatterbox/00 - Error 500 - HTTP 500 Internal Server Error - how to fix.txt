This error bamboozled me for about an hour.

My Air Conditioner app is working fine - using PHP on the same server and hooked up to exactly the same database.
http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/aircond/index.php

But my ChatterBox App:

http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/personcheckin/index.php

would not work.  I reverted back to a known working backup and uploaded it, and it still would not work.

I ran the app locally in XAMPP and it worked perfectly.

None of the associated PHP files worked, for example:

http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/00__Extract_Data_to_CSV.php

had exactly the same error / issue - nothing happened / Error 500.

WTF ???

I logged into my server control panel and checked the databse, tables, settings, etc and everything seemed fine.


I renamed the folder on my local PC:

personcheckin

to:

chatterbox

and FTP uploaded this folder to my web site:

http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/

and ran it:

http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/chatterbox/index.php

and it worked perfectly.

Woo hoo !!

I then deleted the "personcheckin" folder on the server
and renamed "chatterbox" -> "personcheckin"

and navigated to this URL:
http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/personcheckin/index.php

and my App was still working perfectly.

WTF had happened ?  What was going on ???

But there's more ...

A few Refreshes later and the app was back displaying the original symptoms - nothing or ERROR 500.

So I renamed the folder on the server "personcheckin" -> "chatterbox"
and navigated to:
http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/chatterbox/index.php

and it still would NOT work, still displaying the original symptoms - nothing or ERROR 500.


So, I deleted the "chatterbox" folder on the server and re-uploaded all files,
and navigated to:
http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/chatterbox/index.php

and it still would NOT work, still displaying the original symptoms - nothing or ERROR 500.


Holy SHIT !!!

So, I created a "chatterbox2" folder on the server and re-uploaded all files,
and navigated to:
http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/chatterbox2/index.php

and it still would NOT work, still displaying the original symptoms - nothing or ERROR 500.

So, I created a "chat" folder on the server and re-uploaded all files,
and navigated to:
http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/chat/index.php

and it still would NOT work, still displaying the original symptoms - nothing or ERROR 500.


Effing hell !!  I cannot get the app running again ...

My Air Conditioner app is still working fine:
http://moosessoftware.epizy.com/php/aircond/index.php
