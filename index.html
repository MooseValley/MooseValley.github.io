	<p>
	I have been using computers since the very early 1980's, and have used tons
	of software that was "hard to use" and not "user friendly" over the years.
	Software was "hard to use" and not "user friendly" back then because the
	machines were so primitive.  When you've got 48 KB of RAM for everything
	including the OS, the application, and the data, you can only do so much.
	</p>

	<p>
	But some software - even today - seems to go out of its way to
	frustrate and annoy users.
	</p>

	<p>
	<font color=red><b>Microsoft Windows</b></font>
	is a prime candidate here for so many reasons,
	one of which for removing <b>WinHLP</b> support
	(the help file format Windows used for 25+ years and which
	would add a paltry 1 MB to the total install size of Windows,
	which on my laptop tips the scales at 26 GB !).
	In addition, for users like me who still value <b>WinHLP</b> support,
	and go out of my way to install it on modern Windows,
	Windows routinely and automatically deletes the WinHLP support
	I specifically installed - without notifying or asking me -
	when major updates are installed.
	Every few months, I have to reinstall <b>WinHLP</b> support on my machines.
	There are many other frustrations with Windows - like why Windows Explorer has
	to keep changing and messing with my default view all the damned time.
	<b>Shame on you Microsoft !  Shame !</b>
	<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/ohboy.gif">
	</p>

	<p>
	The latest software to really frustrate and annoy me is
	<font color=red><b>Firefox v89</b></font>.
	For me, Firefox has become very crash prone lately,
	crashing multiple times per day.  This is very frustrating.
	But <font color=red><b>Firefox v89</b></font>
	takes this frustration to another level,
	because it adds extra spacing between tabs, menus, and bookmarks,
	and does not provide a simple way to reset it back to how
	it was in all prior versions of Firefox.  Bookmarks menus that used to fit neatly on a screen, now extend way beyond the bounds of the screen.
	<b>Shame on you Mozilla !  Shame !</b>
	<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/ohboy.gif">
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyway, to <b>restore</b> the menu, bookmark, and tab spacing in
	<font color=red><b>Firefox v89</b></font>:
	<UL>
	<Pre>
In Firefox type this in the address bar:

about:config
	-> click Accept Risk and Continue

	search for:
		browser.compactmode.show	- double click it until is says "true".

	search
		browser.proton.enabled		- double click it until is says "false".

	search
		browser.proton.contextmenus.enabled		- double click it until is says "false".
		(This last option fixes the huge spaces between Bookmarks in the Bookmarks menu)

Right click on Title bar
	-> Customize Toolbar
	-> right at the bottom (middle), click the Density combobox and select
		"Compact (not supported)".

Your tabs and bookmarks, spacing, etc will be back to normal.
	</Pre>
	</UL>

	</p>

	<p>
	Hopefully other people out there will find this useful.
	FireFox users almost certainly will.

	Already I can see that the results aren't terrific.
	So far, 40 of the 221 (18.1%) of the emails bounced because the email addresses are no longer valid
	or because the company servers reject emails from external sources.
	Perfectly understandable ... some of these email addresses were used over 10 years ago,
	and companies are becoming increasingly paranoid about external emails (and rightly so).

	I've made lots of mistakes in my life ...
	but this was one of the doozies:
	<UL>
		<p>
		<LI> When I was finishing university (1986),
		I had a good amount of savings built up
		because I had worked on a farm for several years
		(2 years part-time and 1 year full-time) before going to Uni,
		and also because I worked as a barman (up to 40 hours per week)
		while studying at university.  By the time I finished Uni,
		I had over <b>$10,000 AUD</b> in my bank account,
		which was getting around 10% interest or so on term deposits.
		At this time, you could buy a nice house in inner-Brisbane for $45,000,
		so my $10K was really significant savings !!  Easily enough for a big deposit on a house.
		(Today that same house would be $1.8 million).
		<!-- Peter's friend purchased a beautiful house in Highgate Hill (just up the hill from South Bank - easy walking distance to the Brisbane City CBD - for $45,000 just before the Brisbane Expo in 1988.
		Today that house would easily be $1.8 million.
		-->
		</LI>
		</p>

		<p>
		<LI> But at this time, back in mid-1986,
		<b>Microsoft
		(<a target=_blank href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT">MSFT</a>)
		</b>
		had just gone public and I was excited about this and
		was right on the verge of
		putting all of my money into Microsoft stock ...
		but all of my friends at Uni - <b>all Computer Science majors</b> -
		sneered and laughed at me for this "crazy" idea.
		They took the piss out of me for months about this ...
		and from then on, whenever someone had a really crazy idea or did something really stupid, they'd be like
		<i><b>"Oh well, at least you didn't bet the farm on a company like Microsoft, hey Moose ???"</b></i>.
		<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/rofl.gif">
		</LI>
		</p>

		<p>
		<LI> If I had done it - if I had put my $10,000 into Microsoft stock -
		the shares would now be worth over
		<b>$25 million (excluding dividends, etc)</b>.
		<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/ohboy.gif">
		</p>

		<p>
		This is pretty shocking, I had never taken the share price history which included stock splits and done the calculations before today.
		I thought the total would be maybe $500K ...  not $25 million !!
		Oh boy !
		<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/ohboy.gif">
		</LI>
		</p>

		<p>
		<LI> Yep, I still kick myself about this often ...
		<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/cry.gif">
		</LI>
		</p>

	</UL>

	<p>
	Yes, I'm an idiot.  But my friends are much bigger idiots.
	I'm an idiot because I let even bigger idiots talk me out of something that
	I knew was a golden opportunity.  I could see the massive potential ...
	But they could not see it.
	They were completely clueless about how big Microsoft was going to become.
	If they were History or English Literature or whatever majors, this would be excusable.  But they were all Computer Science majors ...  they all had IBM-PC clones at home, they had all been using MS-DOS for several years, they had used Microsoft's software and compilers for several years, and they had seen / used Microsoft Windows 1 ...  But they could not see the big picture or how personal computers and software were going to grow.
	</p>

	<p>
	These are the same guys who started calling me "Moose" as well ...
	(because I looked like Moose from the Archie comic books).
	</p>

I had to put the piano version on

because YouTube seem to ping you for Copyright infringement
if you have any music in your video - even royalty free / copyright free
music that Camtasia Studio provides.  Yes, seriously.
I'm amazed the original video that I uploaded to YouTube
hasn't been pinged for Copyright Infringement for using wave sounds.
Things really are that bad on YouTube now.

	The <b>Global Mortality Rate</b> might end up being higher than the
	1-2% figure used in this video -
	it is currently
	<b>11.46%</b> according to the very latest data from
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData"> John Hopkins University (JHU)</a>
	if you only count the cases where the disease has run its course.
	i.e. people have either recovered or died:
	<UL>
		<b>Mortality Rate = Deaths / (Deaths + Recovered)</b>
	</UL>
	</p>

	<p>
	NOTE: Doctors are being conservative and are slow to declare people as "recovered", and rightly so.
	How do you tell if someone is recovered ?  When they can stand up again ?  When they leave the hospital ?  When the feel well enough to walk outside again ?  When they return to work ?
	So the above formula results in a vastly inflated Mortality Rate to what it will hopefully be when more cases are declared "recovered".

	<p>
	I still believe there's no need to do any panic buying or hoarding, and certainly no need for ugly, sub-human supermarket fights or stampedes - as long as everyone stays calm and buys only what they need, the food and toilet paper will not run out.
	However, apparently a large proportion of the population in the
	US, Australia, the UK, ...
	are <!--stupidly and recklessly--> living way beyond their means and
	have little or no savings for rainy days -
	WHOOPS !!! ... and people are getting scared and are panic buying and hoarding ...
	so who knows what ugly, sub-human behaviour we might witness in the coming weeks / months ...

	<p>
	I have been monitoring the Corona Virus situation and graphing the data for several weeks,
	and have developed a <b>Coronavirus Spread World Map Simulation</b> that allows me to
	step through the data and see how the confirmed cases, deaths,
	and recoveries change over time for each country.
	</p>

	<p>
	My preliminary analyses and simulations suggest:

	<UL>
	<p><LI> There is significant variation in Mortality Rates between countries
		(over 7.1% in Italy, and only 3.9% in China), and,
		</LI></p>
	<p><LI> The Mortality Rate is much higher than reported in the media, which typically ranges from 1% to 3%, and,
		</LI></p>
	<p><LI> There also seems to be proportionally far more deaths in Italy,
		and far less deaths in Korea and China.
		</LI></p>
	<p><LI> And there seems to be proportionally
		far less recoveries in Italy and Korea compared to China.
		</LI></p>
	</UL>

	<p>
	Here are screen shots of my simulation and spreadsheet:

	<h3> Fig 1: Coronavirus Spread WorldMap Animation v0.010.</h3>
	Note: the largest red dot size (of 50 pixels radius) was selected
	so that the countries with few cases still showed up as dots.
	If I made the largest red dot radius 10 pixels, then the countries
	with the low numbers would not even have enough cases to display a single red pixel.

	</p>

	<p>
	My main questions at this stage:
	<UL>
		<p><LI> Is the data being reported by China and other countries honest / accurate / up-to-date ?
			</LI></p>
		<p><LI> Are the numbers of cases, deaths being intentionally under-reported to the media ?
			</LI></p>
	</UL>
	</p>

	<p>
	Under reporting the data to prevent public panic is one thing (there is more than enough hysteria already),
	although this is generally not a good idea - people do not like to be lied to.
	However, if one or more countries are grossly under reporting or blatantly lying about the number of
	cases and/or deaths then this is another matter entirely.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note Well:
	<UL>
		<p><LI> There is so much turmoil because of this virus that JHU may be
			having difficulty getting accurate / up-to-date data.  This is perfectly understandable.
			</LI></p>

		<p><LI> There are various ways to calculate Mortality Rate, as I explain in
			<a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44wll0CVi3E"> Coronavirus Mortality Rates Analysis @ 13-Mar-2020</a>
			video above.
			</LI></p>

		<p><LI> Links to the John Hopkins University data are provided above
			and in the descriptions below each video in my Youtube channel.
			</LI></p>

		<p><LI> Developing this simulation (see videos above) is a great little assignment project
			for my students and I am still developing the tool, so I'm not going to place my
			Java source code on a public Github yet.
			I might even do a "<b>Build Your Own Software</b>" series
			on how to develop this simulation / animation.

		<p><LI> <font color=Red>
			According to the data I have, Coronavirus is NOT spreading exponentially.
			At this stage, there is <b><u>NO CAUSE FOR PANIC</u></b>.</font>

	Until this morning, my web site was hosted with <b>000Webhost</b>,
	but they like to play UPSELL games.
	</p>

	<p>
	Over the last few days my web site has been down,
	because <b>000Webhost</b> claimed my web site was getting 10's of 1,000's of visitors a day
	and therefore I needed <b>$$$ Expensive Hosting Plan A</b>
	before my web site would be allowed to "go live" again.
	</p>

	<p>
	However, StatCounter and my Rebrandly re-director both confirm the true numbers are much lower:
	</p>

	<UL>
	<LI> StatCounter says I averaged <b>3.1 visitors per day</b> over the last 6 months,
		</LI>
	<LI> Rebrandly re-director had 11 clicks - <b>11 visitors - in the past month</b> (since 28-Jan-2020).
		</LI>
	</UL>

	<p>
	Certainly not the 10's of 1,000's <b>000Webhost</b> claimed !
	</p>

	<p>
	I kept emailing <b>000Webhost</b> and telling them the facts, expecting an
	apology email from them any minute, but there was no response ...
	Days went by and all I got was their auto-generated emails
	that were still trying to UPSELL me on expensive hosting plans.
	No response.  No support.  No contact details on their web site.
	Never the slightest evidence to support their bogus claims.  Nothing.
	</p>

	<p>
	It's not the first time this has happened to me.  Many of my prior web hosts
	also tried to play this dirty UPSELL scam on me, but I moved hosts each time.
	</p>

	<p>
	So, farewell <b>000Webhost</b>, and hello my new web host: <b>InfinityFree</b>.
	Long may they reign (aka <i>be host my web host</i>).

	I used to use the "<b>V3 URL</b>" redirector service for my web site ... some long term visitors

	This allowed me to use the same link, but behind the scenes point this to my latest web site url

	which happened approximately every 5-10 years or so.
	</p>

	<P>
	I've also been mulling over ideas for new content ...
	As many of my regular visitors may know,
	I have been very heavily involved in University Education over the past 20 years,
	and I have often wished that I had made videos of the development of many of the
	100+ programs available on my web page to help my students
	understand how the whole development process works.
	And there are probably others out there who would like to see this in actions and understand this.
	</P>

	<P>
	So, I'm thinking of recording a series of new videos to demonstrate
	the entire software development process
	for particular software development projects that I have in mind,
	from end to end including:
	</P>

	<UL>
	<LI> analysis,
	<LI> requirements discovery - story boarding, prototyping, brain storming, ...
	<LI> development,
	<LI> on-line help,
	<LI> context sensitive help,
	<LI> Github version control,
	<LI> automated Unit and Integration testing,
	<LI> manual testing,
	<LI> linking to databases: SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDB, etc,
	<LI> using web services and web APIs: Google YouTube API, London Underground API, etc,
	<LI> processing JSON and XML content,
	<LI> graphics, sound, games, ...
	<LI> cross platform development,
	<LI> web apps (maybe),
	<LI> basic editors (like TextPad, Notepad++, etc) and
		advanced Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), such as Netbeans, Eclipse, etc,
	<LI> go live / roll-out / release,
	<LI> and various other topics.
	</UL>

	<p>
	As always, what I do depends on the response my work receives.
	If people like it and provide nice feedback, then
	I'll produce more.
	If no-one cares or gives a damn, then I might as well go and do something else.
	</P>

	<P>
	Anyway, stay tuned, got some BIG PLANS for 2020 !!!

Some Sag Calculator questions / discussion points .... can you help ?

<UL>

<P><LI> <b>QUESTION #1:</b>
Moose, I have utilized your sag program to sag all of our work in recent years.  We have exclusively used the Tangent 1 and Tangent 2 method sagging straight-line tangent structures.  We have an upcoming project that, for some our wire pulls, does not have a large amount of tangents, and most of the structures are running angles.  How do you best recommend that we go about sagging this wire in running angle spans?  We have a couple ideas, but wanted to see if you had any recommendations.
	</LI></P>

<P><LI> <b>QUESTION #2:</b>
Can I go 85% on a tangent one sag or is that out of the question. Span length is 350 m.

<p>
<b>My reply:</b>
85% is a little bit outside the recommended limit of 20%-80%.
From Sag Calculator's help file:  "<i>Ensure that the point of tangency to the cable at the sagging temperature will give good control ie between 20% and 80% of the span.</i>"
I don't have any information about how quickly errors will creep in as you go beyond these limits.  If you can supply any information about this, then please forward it on to me and I will add it to the help file (giving you full credit).
</p>

	</LI></P>

<P><LI> <b>QUESTION #3:</b>
Hi Mike we are you mostly using tan 2 sagging methods. For our horizontal distance how
much can u move (to the side) off center line so we can see a clear view of all three phases
at one time we are sagging 500 KV four bundle 926.7 conductor.
	</LI></P>

</UL>

<P>
Can anyone out there shed light on these questions / topics ?
</P>
<P>
Or, can you provide any hints, tips, information that would be useful in Sag Calculator's help file ?
</P>
<P>
If you can, then please
<A HREF="email_moose.html">email me</A>
and let me know
and I'll add your reply into Sag Calculator's help file and give you full credit for the answer.

	Basically, anything that I have developed or started to develop

	<b>NOTE:</b> <b>None of the source code</b> for software that I have developed for

	People may be thinking: <i><b>Moose, what are you doing ?  Are you going somewhere ?</b></i>

	is coming, but sadly, I don't think it's going to happen soon enough for me.
	So, I'm just taking steps to ensure my
	software is in order, and as much of my source code as possible is available to anyone
	who wants it or would like to explore it or who maybe could learn from it ....
	before I depart this world.</b></i>

	<p>
	In the future, maybe someone out there is still using my software ?

	<p>
	Maybe someone out there wonders how I coded things ?
	</p>

	<p>
	Maybe someone out there wants to extend or build on one of my projects ?
	</p>

	<p>
	By making my source code available, I'm making sure that my software
	- <b>the creative work of my life</b> -
	can live on ....
	</p>

	<p>
	And if that benefits or helps someone in the future, then that's truly awesome !

	<p>
	Moose's Software Valley has now been live for 23 years.
	That's an incredible amount of time on the internet.
	</p>

	<p>
	I can only think of a handful of web sites who have been on-line longer than me.
	Let's see ... there's <b>Google</b> .....
	and ummmm, oh that's all I can think of ....
	Considering Google launched ~2 years before me, ....
	and made squillions of dollars selling search engine rank ...
	while I focused on creating great, original software ... and made peanuts ...
	Ohh god, don't even think about stuff like that ...  :(
	</p>

	<p>
	I did a search of "old web sites" 2 days ago, and came across:
	<a target=_blank href="http://www.404pagefound.com/"> 404pagefound
	(http://www.404pagefound.com/)</a>.
	It turns out there are many 100's of web sites that are as old or
	even older than mine that are still up and running.
	Even the old Netscape web site I remember visiting in 1993
	is still up and running ....
	I never knew .....
	Well done everyone involved !!
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyway, according to their
	<a target=_blank href="http://www.404pagefound.com/about/"> About</a>
	page:
	<UL>
	<UI>
	<LI> 404PageFound started in May 2009 with the goal of uncovering dated websites (generally from 1994-2001) that are still active and have avoided major updates.
		</LI>
	</UL>
	</p>

	<p>
	Thinking about that last part,
	my web site has certainly avoided major updates,
	it's got minimal CSS and JS (just for the buttons / menus above),
	it's not database driven (even though I have been close a couple of times),
	and all of the content is still all just basic HTML,
	exactly the same as it was back in 1996.
	</p>

	<p>
	Yes, my web site went through a redesign back in 2014:
	<UL>
		<LI> <a target=_blank href="http://moosesoftware.netau.net/previous_page_changes.html#Web_Site_ReDesign__31_Oct-2014"> 31-Oct-2014 :: Web Site Re-Design and Massive Reduction / Re-Focus</a>
			</LI>
	</UL>

	<p>
	but that was pretty minor: change focus to just be on my software,
	removed all other content, drop the HTML frames,
	improve the colours, and
	adopt a better style for post banners (a nice HTML table).
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyway, they did not have my web site web site in their list, so
	I submitted my web site.  Not sure how active they are or how long it
	will take for them to add me ...
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyway, will I be on-line for the 30 anniversary ??
	Probably ... if my health holds out ... what else am I gonna do ?
