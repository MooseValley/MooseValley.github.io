	<p>
	Moose's Software Valley has now been live for 23 years.
	That's an incredible amount of time on the internet.
	</p>

	<p>
	I can only think of a handful of web sites who have been on-line longer than me.
	Let's see ... there's <b>Google</b> .....
	and ummmm, oh that's all I can think of ....
	Considering Google launched ~2 years before me, ....
	and made squillions of dollars selling search engine rank ...
	while I focused on creating great, original software ... and made peanuts ...
	Ohh god, don't even think about stuff like that ...  :(
	</p>

	<p>
	I did a search of "old web sites" 2 days ago, and came across:
	<a target=_blank href="http://www.404pagefound.com/"> 404pagefound
	(http://www.404pagefound.com/)</a>.
	It turns out there are many 100's of web sites that are as old or
	even older than mine that are still up and running.
	Even the old Netscape web site I remember visiting in 1993
	is still up and running ....
	I never knew .....
	Well done everyone involved !!
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyway, according to their
	<a target=_blank href="http://www.404pagefound.com/about/"> About</a>
	page:
	<UL>
	<UI>
	<LI> 404PageFound started in May 2009 with the goal of uncovering dated websites (generally from 1994-2001) that are still active and have avoided major updates.
		</LI>
	</UL>
	</p>

	<p>
	Thinking about that last part,
	my web site has certainly avoided major updates,
	it's got minimal CSS and JS (just for the buttons / menus above),
	it's not database driven (even though I have been close a couple of times),
	and all of the content is still all just basic HTML,
	exactly the same as it was back in 1996.
	</p>

	<p>
	Yes, my web site went through a redesign back in 2014:
	<UL>
		<LI> <a target=_blank href="http://moosesoftware.netau.net/previous_page_changes.html#Web_Site_ReDesign__31_Oct-2014"> 31-Oct-2014 :: Web Site Re-Design and Massive Reduction / Re-Focus</a>
			</LI>
	</UL>

	<p>
	but that was pretty minor: change focus to just be on my software,
	removed all other content, drop the HTML frames,
	improve the colours, and
	adopt a better style for post banners (a nice HTML table).
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyway, they did not have my web site web site in their list, so
	I submitted my web site.  Not sure how active they are or how long it
	will take for them to add me ...
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyway, will I be on-line for the 30 anniversary ??
	Probably ... if my health holds out ... what else am I gonna do ?

	<p>
	Yesterday, my work bought me a new laptop, and it's a real sweet piece of kit:
	an <b>Asus ZenBook Pro 15</b>, Windows 10 x64, 16GB RAM, 500 GB SDD, Core i7 CPU (12xCPUs), with a beautiful, high quality finish.
	See: <a target=_blank href="https://www.asus.com/Laptops/ASUS-ZenBook-15-UX534FT/"> https://www.asus.com/Laptops/ASUS-ZenBook-15-UX534FT/</a>
	</p>

	<p>
	<img src="pics/Asus ZenBook - Laptop zoom - ScreenPad - apps running.jpg" align=right width=50%>
	But, apart from being a powerful, awesome, and beautiful piece of kit,
	it's also got something quite interesting.
	As well as having a gorgeous main screen, I can connect
	3 external monitors at once - making a really nice 4 screen set-up.</p>

	<p>
	In addition, the <b>TrackPad</b> / <b>MousePad</b>
	is also a small, high-res screen.
	Asus call it a <b>ScreenPad</b>.
	You can run a bunch of specially developed ScreenPad apps there
	(calculator, calendar, music player, video player, etc),
	and some software, like Office, automatically uses it so you can
	use the ScreenPad to change settings in your document, etc.
	See: <a target=_blank href="https://www.asus.com/ScreenPad-APPs/"> https://www.asus.com/ScreenPad-APPs/</a>
	</p>

	<p>
	But the ScreenPad has several modes of operation, and
	one of those turns it into an additional display screen.
	</p>
	<h3>So my laptop can in effect have 5 screens:
	<h3>So my laptop can have:
	Main Screen + 3 External Monitors + ScreenPad = 5 screens ... OMG !!!
	<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/smilie.gif">
	</h3>

	<p>
	To turn the ScreenPad into an additional display screen, I pressed <b>F6</b>, and selected "<b>Extender Mode</b>", and the ScreenPad sprang into life
	as another monitor, and I can drag any apps I like down there and run
	them, just like I can do for any other external monitor.
	</p>

	<p>
	And within seconds, I had all of these running in my ScreenPad at once:
	<UL>

	<p><LI> <a href="mooses_freeware.html#CPUs_Monitor"> CPUs Monitor</a>
	a Delphi app I developed back in October 2015 to monitor CPU utilisation on PCs with multiple CPUs, and also calculate and display the average CPU usages for whatever settings / timeframes you like.

	<p><LI> <a href="mooses_freeware.html#Big_Mouse_Pointer"> Big Mouse Pointer</a>
	my old Delphi app that I developed many years ago

	<h2>HAXE</h2>
	<p>
	<b>TL;DR:</b> "HAXE is a transpiler, cross platform powerhouse that has unlimited potential for games, applications, web, ...", Moose OMalley.
	</p>
	<p>
	Haxe is FREE, open source, and pretty amazing.
	To quote the Haxe web site (<a target=_blank href="https://haxe.org/">https://haxe.org/</a>)
	web site:
	</p>
	<UL>
		<p>
		<i> Haxe is an open source toolkit based on a modern, high level, strictly typed programming language, a cross-compiler, a complete cross-platform standard library and ways to access each platform's native capabilities.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
		<i> With Haxe, you can easily build cross-platform tools targeting all the mainstream platforms natively.</i>
		</p>
	</UL>

	<p>
	With HAXE, you code in a language called <b>HAXE</b>, which is like
	<b>ActionScript</b> (<a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript</a>),
	and for me it feels a lot like
	<b>C#</b> (<a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)</a>),
	and it can cross compile (transpile) your code to native apps, games to:
	</p>

	<UL>
	iOS,
	Android,
	HTML5,
	Neko,
	NodeJS,
	Flash,
	Neko,
	ActionScript,
	AIR,
	C#,
	C++,
	HashLink,
	Java,
	JavaScript,
	Lime,
	Lua,
	OpenFL,
	PHP,
	Python,
	TypeScript,
	</UL>

	<p>
	For example, to cross compile (transpile) your HAXE code to
	<b>Javascript</b> (<a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript</a>):
	</p>

	<UL>
	<b>haxe -main Main.hx -js main.js</b>
	</UL>

	<p>
	If that's all Haxe did, it would still be pretty amazing.
	You could avoid all of the major, hideous JavaScript issues,
	and program in a nice, safe, statically typed language (HAXE),
	and generate the nasty JS out the back end.
	</p>

	<p>
	But HAXE is so much  more.  Want
	<b>Python</b> (<a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)</a>)
	?  Simple ! Just cross compile (transpile) your HAXE code to Python:
	</p>

	<UL>
	<b>haxe -main Main.hx -python main.py</b>
	</UL>

	<p>
	Or Java, or TypeScript, or Lua, or PHP, or C#, or C++, or ....
	well, you get the picture.
	<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/smilie.gif">
	</p>

	<p>
	HAXE installation is quick and simple (a ~5 MB installer).
	Adding additional external libraries is easy
	(a simple command on the command line to install).
	Some of the additional libraries:
	</p>
	<UL>
	<table border=1 width=90%>
	<tr>
		<th><b>Library</b></th>
		<th>Type </th>
		<th>More Info</th>
	</tr>

		<td><b>Heaps</b></td>
		<td>Game engine / framework </td>
		<td><a target=_blank href="https://heaps.io/"> https://heaps.io/</a></td>

		<td><b>HaxeFlixel </b></td>
		<td>Game engine / framework </td>

	<tr>
		<td><b>Nape</b></td>
		<td>Physics engine </td>
		<td><a target=_blank href="https://joecreates.github.io/napephys"> https://joecreates.github.io/napephys</a></td>
	</tr>

	</table>

	</UL>
	<p>
	and many others provide game / graphics / application framework / etc support
	so you can build cross platform 2D and 3D games, as well as full-blown applications.
	</p>

	<p>
	On Windows, there's an editor called
	<b>HaxeDevelop</b> (~13 MB, <a target=_blank href="https://www.haxedevelop.org">https://www.haxedevelop.org</a>)
	which is great for working with HAXE, or you can use
	<b>VS Code</b> (<a target=_blank href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>)
	or another editor.
	</p>

	<p>
	<img src="pics/Haxe and Heaps - Moose Avitar bouncer, resize.png" align=right width=50%>
	Getting fonts, sprites, etc moving on screen, animating, bouncing around, is very easy.
	Within an hour or so of discovering HAXE, I had worked out enough to bounce a
	bunch of heads round my browser window.
	</p>

	<p>
	It's all pretty amazing.
	<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/smilie.gif">
	</p>

	<p>
	So far, I've spent about a day or so over several months (very much part-time) learning HAXE,
	and have almost fallen in love with HAXE, and I might yet ....
	</p>

	<p>
	But ... <i>why is there's always a but ??</i>
	It's not a complete rose garden ...
	</p>

	<p>
	Firstly, the documentation, on-line help, and tutorials just aren't there yet,
	especially for the external libraries (Heaps, Nape, etc).
	500 lines of uncommented code is not a tutorial, even for a
	seasoned veteran programming beast like me.
	For me, it felt like every step beyond the basics is a maze of guess work and
	trial and error and hours of frustration.
	</p>

	<p>
	Secondly, the cross compiling nature isn't quite as open or as flexible as I hoped.
	e.g. if you target HTML5, then your project wont just cross compile to Android or iOS.
	The target is important.  It determines what libraries, etc you are allowed to use,
	and these don't cross compile to other targets (maybe one day ??).
	</p>

	<p>
	But it's still early days.  There's a great community and dev team behind the project,
	and significant improvements are on the way with HAXE v4.0.
	</p>

	<p>
	So, I haven't given up on HAXE yet .....  not by a long shot.
	<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/smilie.gif">
	</p>

	<p>
	And if I can add my own tutorials, information, etc, to make HAXE better, easier to learn,
	etc then I'll certainly be doing that.
	Actually, that's another great thing about HAXE.
	A lone developer like me can contribute tutorials, how to's,
	notes, help, video tutorials, source code, ... and make a
	real difference and be a force for good for the community.
	<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/smilie.gif">
	In contrast, I could spend lifetimes contributing to the Java or C# communities
	and not even make a blip on the radar.
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyway, HAXE sure is a promising project, with loads of potential.
	</p>

	<b>TL;DR:</b> "Unity was not a good fit for me.  I want to be able to do everything in code and not have to deal with a monstrously overly complex IDE with bajillions of options, checkboxes, buttons, panels, menus, toolbars, slide down / slide open panels, ...", Moose OMalley.
	</p>

	<h3>The Long story:</h3>

	<p>
	Back in early 2016, I enrolled in a 4 week post-grad Unity Games development course ...
	I had 4 weeks "holiday" (i.e. gap) between jobs and invested all of my time into learning
	Unity (<a target=_blank href="https://unity.com/">https://unity.com/</a>).
	</p>

	<p>
	See my prior web page updates:
	<UL>
	<LI> <a target=_blank href="http://moosesoftware.netau.net/previous_page_changes.html#UNITY_DEV__2016_02_06"> 6-Mar-2016 :: More Unity Development</a>
		</LI>
	<LI> <a target=_blank href="http://moosesoftware.netau.net/previous_page_changes.html#UNITY_DEV__2016_03_06"> 6-Feb-2016 :: Recent Activity = Unity Development</a>
		</LI>
	</UL>
	</p>

	<p>
	And I went "the whole hog".
	I put my life on hold and completely devoted 4 weeks of my life to learning
	Unity full time (7 days a week, and well over 100+ hours per week for 4 weeks).
	</p>

	<p>
	<img src="pics/Unity_Dev__collage__v0,002__vert.jpg" align=right width=50%>
	As well as completing all of the course work, assignments, and
	getting top marks for everything, I did tons of extra side projects
	and explored way beyond what the course covered.
	I really went at it full bore.  The whole hog.
	But, at the end of the 4 weeks, I had barely scratched the surface
	of what Unity provides, and I was still a long way from being confident ...
	</p>

	<p>
	In Unity, there are bajillions of GUI options, that you cannot easily
	(at least initially) setup / control from code.
	Near the end of the 4 weeks, I worked through videos creating a
	<b>2D Tank Battle</b> game for fun, where they supplied all the graphics and art
	and some of the code, and the tanks had little health bars, and
	I realised how far I still had to go.
	</p>

	<p>
	It wasn't the complexity.  It wasn't the code.
	It wasn't the principles, topics, etc.
	</p>

	<p>
	For me, the BIG ISSUE was my constant battle with the Unity IDE:
	<UL>
	<p><LI> What was the option called to let me do X,Y,Z ...
		</LI></p>
	<p><LI> Where on earth is option X in the quagmire of IDE screens,
	panels, menus, toolbars, slide down / slide open panels, ...
		</LI></p>
	</UL>
	</p>

	<p>
	For goodness sakes Unity, let me do everything from code !!!
	e.g. need to set gravity to 0 or 20 ?  Let me do that from code, such as something like:
	</p>
	<UL>
		<b>player.gravity = -9.8;</b>
	</UL>

	<p>
	Want to give a game object a collider ?  Let me do that from code, such as something like:
	</p>
	<UL>
		<b>player.addCollider (new BoxCollider (20, 20, 10, 15) );</b>
	</UL>

	<p>
	I don't want to have to open multiple toolbars, slide open 5-10 panels,
	and hunt for the right data entry box or option.  Just let me do it !
	</p>

	<p>
	Unity for me was like <b>finger nails on a chalk board</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
	Note: I do know there are devs out there who script Unity ...
	to avoid dealing with the monstrously overly complex IDE ....
	but these people are pretty openly laughed at in the Unity Community.
	[If I continue with Unity, I would be one of the "script everything" people.]
	</p>


	<p>
	What I hoped was going to be my entry into cross platform games development
	turned to dust in my mouth.
	</p>

	<p>
	Shortly after completing the 4 week course, I started a new job (well 2 in fact, but that's another story),
	and things have been crazy busy since.
	</p>

	<p>
	And also recently, about a month ago, I decided to give Unity another chance ...
	However, the installer brought back many memories ....
	If you want a bare bones Unity install, it is a 20 GB approx download.
	If you want a full blown install with iOS emulator, etc,
	then your going to be downloading ~45 GB of stuff,
	which probably expand to well over 100 GB of hard disk space once installed.
	I went for the full install ....
	My PC churned away for hours installing god knows what ....
	</p>

	<p>
	And that's another issue I have with Unity.
	As visitors to my web site well know,
	nothing gets near my machine without being thoroughly scanned and checked by
	<b>Virus Total</b> (<a target=_blank href="http://www.virustotal.com/">http://www.virustotal.com/</a>),
	and other software.
	And even then I run just about everything sandboxed or in a VM (virtual machine).
	Yes, I am that careful and paranoid.
	Software developers need to be for the sake of their clients / users.
	So, if I am forced to download an installer, and it goes out across the
	net and grabs bits and pieces and installs them,
	then I cannot do my pre-install checks.
	And I hate that !
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyway, when the 45+ GB was downloaded, and Unity was installed,
	I could not get past the
	"<b>enter a license key</b>" screen and actually run Unity.
	I had downloaded the FREE version and it wanted a license key.
	To be honest, I kinda gave up on Unity at that point.
	Didn't search the web for an answer.
	Didn't try ...  just could not be bothered battling with Unity any longer ...
	<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/ohboy.gif">
	</p>

	<p>
	All I could think was: "<b>Oh, for Fuck's sake Unity !!!</b>".
	<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/facepalm.gif">
	</p>

	<p>
	However, I am often thinking about cross-platform application
	and game development.  And I am always exploring and thinking ....
	hmmm, would this be a good language / environment to re-develop a new cross platform
	<a href="http://moosesoftware.netau.net/overhead_cable_sag_calculator.html"> Sag Calculator</a>
	in ....

	Since the earliest days of <b>Moose's Software Valley</b>, I have helped

	For example, as well as providing over 100 software titles for free:
	<UL>
	<p><LI> I have replied to many dozens of emails
		over the years asking
		<b>"<i>How did you do .... ??? </i>"</b>

	To start things off, I am releasing my work so far on additional programming questions
	which aims to provides a range of interesting problems to explore and

	<b>Full Screen Background</b>
	is a simple little program that
	creates a full screen "background" over your desktop
	and any underlying applications that you want to hide.
	</P>

	<P>
	Why is this useful ?  I'm often doing screen shots, live
	demos, and recording desktop videos using tools like Camtasia
	Studio, and I don't want to show / include the clutter of
	my desktop icons, or show any material in any open documents
	that I'd rather keep private, so I needed a program that I
	could run and it will cover everything below it - no more
	desktop clutter, no more private information revealed,
	no more worries about prying eyes of strangers or "busy bodies"
	walking by, etc.

	<b>Emoji Buddy</b>
	is a simple little program that lets you
	quickly and easily access some of my favourite Unicode
	Emoji and other characters.
	</P>

	<P>
	Click any button and the Unicode character is copied into
	the Clipboard buffer on your Windows, Mac, Linux computer,
	so you can paste it into Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, any
	word processing document, presentation, spreadsheet, etc.
	</P>

	<P>
	If you place the mouse pointer over any button, a tooltip
	will display the a brief description of the Unicode character.
	e.g. "<i>Rolling on Floor Laughing</i>".
	</P>

	<P>
	If you want all of the Unicode characters, click the "All"
	button and paste them wherever you need them.
	</P>

	<P>
	No need to visit web sites, or load a word processing document
	containing your favourite Emojis, just run my tiny Emoji Buddy
	program and click a button and then paste the characters wherever
	you need it.
	</P>

	<P>
	I personally use Emoji Buddy several times a day on my machines.

	Well, I finally did it ....  after many years of browsing
	Wikipedia and thinking
	<i>"Why the hell does this person / company / software developer have a
	Wikipedia page and not Moose's Software Valley ????"</i>,
	I have decided to go through the process of creating a
	Wikipedia page for Moose's Software Valley.
	</P>

	<P>
	I have started to create a Wikipedia page for Moose's Software Valley
	in the past, but I was always dissuaded by this
	Wikipedia criteria:
	</P>

	<P>
	<UL>
		<LI> <i>"First, please be aware that Wikipedia is an
			encyclopedia, and our mission is to share accepted knowledge
			to benefit people who want to learn. <b>We are not</b> social media
			or <b>a place to promote a company or product or person</b>, or a
			place to advocate for or against anyone or anything.
			Please keep this in mind, always."</i>
			</LI>
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	But there are 1,000's of Wikipedia articles that promote
	companies and/or products and/or people.
	So why not me ?  Why not my software valley ?
	My 107 software titles (106 are free) certainly provides a range of
	"<i>benefits to people</i>" and I certainly
	"<i>share accepted knowledge to benefit people who want to learn</i>"
	on my web site.
	So, why not a Wikipedia page for Moose's Software Valley ?
	</P>


	<P>
	So, I have finally gone ahead and
	created a Wikipedia page for Moose's Software Valley:
	</P>

	<P>
	<UL>
		<LI> <a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Moose's_Software_Valley">
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Moose's_Software_Valley
			</a>
			</LI>
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	Wikipedia told me:
	<UL>
		<LI> <i>"This may take <b>more than two months</b>,
			since drafts are reviewed in no specific order. There are 2530
			pending submissions waiting for review."</i>
			</LI>
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	<br>
	</P>

	<h2>UPDATE:</h2>
	<P>
	But already, just ~20 minutes later, the "great people" at
	Wikipedia have made their decision:
	<UL>
		<LI> <i>"This draft may meet Wikipedia's <b>criteria for speedy
			deletion</b> because in its current form <b>it serves only to promote
			or publicise an entity, person, product, or idea</b>, and
			would require a fundamental rewrite in order to become encyclopedic."</i>
			</LI>
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	So thanks to Wikipedia massively lopsided and biased rules,
	I have just wasted hours of my time .....
	</P>

	<P>
	Am I surprised ?  No, not particularly.
	<br>Am I disappointed ?  Hell yeah.
	<br>Am I annoyed with Wikipedia and frustrated at their
	massively lopsided and biased rules ?
	HELL YEAH !!!
	<br>Wikipedia beg for money nearly every time you visit their site.
	Will I be donating money to support Wikipedia any time soon ?
	Haaa haaa, nope.

	Happy New Year everyone !
	<IMG SRC="pics/emoticons/smilie.gif">
	First post for the new year ...
	Oh boy, time is rushing on ...
	</p>

	<p>
	One thing I've rarely done is watch videos of people playing games
	on YouTube or anywhere else, apart from the very occasional (maybe once a year)
	video that showed a world record, speed run, or
	showed Easter Eggs or game bugs, or something like that.
	</p>

	<p>
	<IMG SRC = "pics/mr_wobbles.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=15%>

	But recently I have started watching videos of people playing games, mostly
	<a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rust"> Rust</a>
	and
	<a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Day+Z"> Day Z</a>,
	and I soon found this crazy guy - aka
	<a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMisterWobbles/videos"> Mr Wobbles</a>
	- singing Christmas Carols (LOL) to people caught in
	<a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Rchamb21/videos"> RCham's</a>
	RUST trap base videos:

	</UL>

	<p>
	Amazed at his voice, I started watching his other videos, and they went from the
	amazing:

	<b>Fly Me To The Moon - Frank Sinatra [covered by Mr. Wobbles]</b>,
	(<a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKmJ7HtvvIk"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKmJ7HtvvIk</a>),

	to his absolutely amazingly beautiful rendition of <b>Country Roads</b> in
	<b>Guess the song or DIE... (Rust Electric Trap Base #1)</b>,
	(13:00, <a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg-A2gzrbZg&t=10m05s"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg-A2gzrbZg&t=10m05s</a>),

	to his haunting
	<b>Killing them with MUSIC (SOS Battle Royale)</b>,
	(13:41, <a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhu1N45bCcw"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhu1N45bCcw</a>),

	and then onto other awesome videos
	<b>Grandpa surprises GIRLS on Omegle with his secret</b>,
	(15:36, <a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl7bs9s4R7o"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl7bs9s4R7o</a>),

	and so on.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you are bored and there's nothing on TV, do yourself a favor and watch these videos.
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyway, hats off to you
	<a target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMisterWobbles/videos"> Mr Wobbles</a>
	- it's awesome to see you doing your thing and doing it so well.
	You have a hell of a set of pipes on you, and
	I'd sure love to be able to sing like you.
